<h1>ABC
<br /><span class="smallest">OF THE</span>
<br />STEEL SQUARE
<br /><span class="smaller">AND ITS USES</span></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">being a condensed compilation from the copyrighted
works of Fred T. Hodgson, author of
&ldquo;THE STEEL SQUARE AND ITS USES,&rdquo; &ldquo;PRACTICAL
CARPENTRY&rdquo; and numerous other works
on building and construction</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present compilation and new matter is made up into
three divisions&mdash;A, B and C.</p>
<p class="center"><b class="large">DIVISION A</b></p>
<p>This Division describes the various kinds of squares,
their markings, their uses, and application in the solution
of simple problems.</p>
<p class="center"><b class="large">DIVISION B</b></p>
<p>This Division shows how the Square may be used for
obtaining the cuts, bevels, and lengths of all sorts of rafters
for roofs of every description. It also shows methods for
finding Hopper and other bevels, brace cuts and lengths,
and raking cornices.</p>
<p class="center"><b class="large">DIVISION C</b></p>
<p>This shows what no other work on the Steel Square does,
a number of easy solutions of Handrailing Problems, by
the square. Something that has not been done or attempted
in book form before. This division is made up mostly of
questions and answers from practical mechanics.</p>

<br />INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
<br /><span class="sc">Division A.</span></h2>
<p>I will not attempt in this small treatise, to
give an historical account of the origin, growth
and development of the square, as the subject
has been treated of at length in my larger
works, as I do not care to pad out these pages
with matter that is not of a severely practical
nature.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, that while iron squares, figured
on their faces in inches and feet, and smaller
divisions, have been made in England and
Belgium for 200 years or more, the genuine
steel square, as we now know it, is a purely
American product, and it has no equal, as no
European manufacturer has as yet been able to
turn out a square anything like as good or perfect
in finish, graduation, or general get-up, as
Sargent &amp; Co., of New Haven, Conn.; Nicholls
Co., Ottumwa, Iowa; and The Peck, Stow &amp;
Wilcox Co., Southington, Conn. Squares made
by any one of these firms named, may be relied
upon as being as near perfect as it is possible to
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
make them in everything that pertains to accuracy,
durability and general finish. The
American workman should feel proud of the
fact that he possesses a Steel Square of purely
Home production which has no equal in the
world.</p>
<p>There is nothing of more importance to a
young man who is learning the business of
house-joinery and carpentry, than that he
should make himself thoroughly conversant
with the capabilities of the tools he employs.
It may be that, in some of the rules shown in
this work, the result could be attained much
readier with other aids than the square; but
the progressive mechanic will not rest satisfied
with one method of performing operations when
others are within his reach.</p>
<p>In the hand of the intelligent mechanic the
square becomes a simple calculating machine of
the most wonderful capacity, and by it he solves
problems of the kinds continually arising in
mechanical work, which by the ordinary methods
are more difficult to perform.</p>
<p>The great improvement which the arts and
manufactures have attained within the last fifty
years, renders it essential that every person engaged
therein should use his utmost exertions
to obtain a perfect knowledge of the trade he
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
professes to follow. It is not enough, nowadays,
for a person to have attained the character
of a good workman; that phrase implies that
quantum of excellence, which consists in working
correctly and neatly, under the directions of
others. The workman of to-day, to excel, must
understand the principles of his trade, and be
able to apply them correctly in practice. Such
a one has a decided advantage over his fellow-workman;
and if to his superior knowledge he
possesses a steady manner, and industrious habits,
his efforts cannot fail of being rewarded.</p>
<p>It is no sin not to know much, though it is
a great one not to know all we can, and put it
all to good use. Yet, how few mechanics there
are who will know all they can? Men apply for
employment daily who claim to be finished mechanics,
and profess to be conversant with all
the ins and outs of their craft, and who are
noways backward in demanding the highest
wages going, who, when tested, are found wanting
in knowledge of the simplest formulas of
their trade. They may, perhaps, be able to perform
a good job of work after it is laid out for
them by a more competent hand; they may have
a partial knowledge of the uses and application
of their tools; but, generally, their knowledge
ends here. Yet some of these men have worked
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
at this trade or that for a third of a century,
and are to all appearances, satisfied with the
little they learned when they were apprentices.
True, mechanical knowledge was not always so
easily obtained as at present, for nearly all
works on the constructive arts were written by
professional architects, engineers, and designers,
and however unexceptionable in other respects,
they were generally couched in such language,
technical and mathematical, as to be perfectly
unintelligible to the majority of workmen; and
instead of acting as aids to the ordinary inquirer,
they enveloped in mystery the simplest
solutions of every-day problems, discouraging
nine-tenths of workmen on the very threshold of
inquiry, and causing them to abandon further
efforts to master the intricacies of their respective
trades.</p>
<p>Of late years, a number of books have been
published, in which the authors and compilers
have made commendable efforts to simplify matters
pertaining to the arts of carpentry and
joinery, and the mechanic of to-day has not the
difficulties of his predecessors to contend with.
The workman of old could excuse his ignorance
of the higher branches of his trade, by saying
that he had no means of acquiring a knowledge
of them. Books were beyond his reach, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
trade secrets were guarded so jealously, that
only a limited few were allowed to know them,
and unless he was made of better stuff than the
most of his fellow-workmen, he was forced to
plod on in the same groove all his days.</p>
<p>Not so with the mechanic of today; if he is
not well up in all the minuti&aelig; of his trade, he
has but himself to blame, for although there is
no royal road to knowledge, there are hundreds
of open ways to obtain it; and the young mechanic
who does not avail himself of one or other
of these ways to enrich his mind, must lack
energy, or be altogether indifferent about his
trade, and may be put down as one who will
never make a workman.</p>
<p>I have thought that it would not be out of
place to preface this work on the &ldquo;Steel Square,&rdquo;
with the foregoing remarks, in the hope that
they may stimulate the young mechanic, and
urge him forward to conquer what at best are
only imaginary difficulties. A willing heart and
a clear head will most assuredly win honorable
distinction in any trade, if they are only properly
used. Indeed, during an experience of many
years in the employment and superintendence of
mechanics of every grade, from the green &ldquo;wood-haggler&rdquo;
to the finished and accomplished workman,
I have invariably discovered that the finished
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
workman was the result of persistent
study and application, and not, as is popularly
supposed, a natural or spontaneous production.
It is true that some men possess greater natural
mechanical abilities than others, and consequently
a greater aptitude in grasping the
principles that underlie the constructive arts;
but, as a rule, such men are not reliable; they
may he expert, equal to any mechanical emergency,
and quick at mastering details, but they
are seldom thorough, and never reliable where
long sustained efforts are required.</p>
<p>The mechanic who reaches a fair degree of
perfection by experience, study and application
is the man who rises to the surface, and
whose steadiness and trustworthiness force
themselves on the notice of employers and superintendents.
I have said this in order to give
encouragement to those young mechanics who
find it up-hill work to master the intricacies of
the various arts they are engaged in, for they
may rest assured that in the end <i>work</i> and <i>application</i>
will be sure to win; and I am certain
that a thorough study of the Steel Square and
its capabilities will do more than anything else
to aid the young workman in mastering many
of the mechanical difficulties that will confront
him from time to time in his daily occupation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>It must not be supposed that the work here
presented exhausts the subject. The enterprising
mechanic will find opportunity for using the
square in the solution of many problems that
will crop up during his daily work, and the
principles herein laid down will aid very much
towards correct solutions. In framing roofs,
bridges, trestle-work, and constructions of timber,
the Steel Square is a necessity to the American
carpenter; but only a few of the more
intelligent workmen ever use it for other purposes
than to make measurements, lay off the
mortices and tenons, and square over the various
joints. Now, in framing bevel work of any description,
the square may be used with great
advantage and profit. Posts, girts, braces, and
struts of every imaginable kind may be laid out
by this wonderful instrument, if the operator
will only study the plans with a view of making
use of his square for obtaining the various bevels,
lengths and cuts required to complete the
work in hand. Tapering structures&mdash;the most
difficult the framer meets with&mdash;do not contain
a single bevel or length that can not be found
by the square when properly applied, and it is
this fact I wish to impress on my readers, for
it would be impossible, in this work, to give every
possible application of the square to work
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of this kind. I have, therefore, only given such
examples as will enable any one to apply some
one of them to any work in hand.</p>
<p>In the foregoing sketch I have given a few
hints as to the kind of square to purchase when
it is necessary to buy; in many cases, however,
this book will find its way into the hands of
mechanics and others, who will have old and
favorite squares in their chests or workshops,
and who will not care to dispose of a &ldquo;well-tried
friend&rdquo; for the purpose of filling its place with
another, simply because I have recommended it.
To these workmen I would say that I do not
advise a change, provided the old square is true,
and the inches and sub-divisions are properly
and accurately defined. I wish it distinctly
understood that old squares, if true, and marked
with inches and sub-divisions of inches, will perform
nearly every solution presented in this
book.</p>
<p>The lines and figures formed on the squares
of different make, sometimes vary, both as to
their position on the square, and their mode of
application, but a thorough understanding of
the application of the scales and lines shown on
any first-class tool, will enable the student to
comprehend the use of the lines and figures exhibited
on other first-class squares.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>To insure good results, it is necessary to be
careful in the selection of the tool. The blade
of the square should be 24 inches long, and
two inches wide, and the tongue from 14 to 18
inches long and 1&frac12; inches wide. The tongue
should be exactly at right angles with the blade,
or in other words the &ldquo;square&rdquo; should be perfectly
square.</p>
<p>To test this question, get a board, about 12
or 14 inches wide, and four feet long, dress it
on one side, and true up one edge as near
straight as it is possible to make it. Lay the
board on the bench, with the dressed side up,
and the trued edge towards you, then apply the
square, with the blade to the left, and mark
across the prepared board with a penknife blade,
pressing close against the edge of the tongue;
this process done to your satisfaction, reverse the
square, and move it until the tongue is close up
to the knife mark; if you find that the edge of
the tongue and mark coincide, it is proof that
the tool is correct enough for your purposes.
Later on, I will show by diagram how this test
is performed.</p>
<p>This, of course, relates to the outside edge of
the blade, and the outside edge of the tongue.
If these edges should not be straight, or should
not prove perfectly true, they should be filed
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
or ground until they are straight and true. The
outside edge of the blade should also be
&ldquo;trued&rdquo; up and made exactly parallel with the
inside edge, if such is required. The same process
should be gone through on the tongue. As
a rule, squares made by firms of repute are perfect,
and require no adjusting; nevertheless, it
is well to make a critical examination before
purchasing.</p>
<p>The next thing to be considered is the use of
the figures, lines, and scales, as exhibited on
the square. It is supposed that the ordinary
divisions and sub-divisions of the inch, into
halves, quarters, eighths, and sixteenths are
understood by the student; and that he also
understands how to use that part of the square
that is subdivided into twelfths of an inch.
This being conceded, we now proceed to describe
the various rules as shown on all good
squares; but before proceeding further, it may
not be out of place to state, that on the squares
recommended in this book, one edge is subdivided
into thirty-seconds of an inch.</p>
<p>This fine sub-division will be found very useful,
particularly so when used as a scale to
measure drawings made in half, one-quarter, one-eighth
or one-sixteenth of an inch to the foot.</p>

<h3 id="c2">PRACTICAL USES OF THE
<br />STEEL SQUARE</h3>
<p>We now take up a square void of any attachments,
and one which has become quite popular
in the west and the middle southern states. I
refer to the &ldquo;Nicholls Square,&rdquo; a representation
of one side of which is shown at <a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>.
This square is a new one on the market, and
presents some advantages over many now being
sold. The manufacturers direct special attention
to the fact that the board measure has
been replaced by a simple rule for framing, and
that there is to be found the lengths and figures
giving the cuts for an entire roof, also the cuts
for cornice of the same. The tongue on the
square is 1&frac34; inches wide, thus making it convenient
for spacing, as much of the dimension
lumber is 1&frac34; inches thick. The general directions
for using this square&mdash;a copy of which
is given to every purchaser of a square&mdash;are
presented herewith, so that the reader will be
able himself to judge of the merits of the tool.
These squares are numbered or graded according
to the graduation marks and quality of
finish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_1">
<img src="images/ppg01.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="800" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The face of a square is the side on
which we stamp our name. The reverse
is the back. The longer arm is the
body, the other is the tongue.</p>
<p><i>Framing Rule.</i>&mdash;The first line of
figures gives the length of common
rafters for one foot run.</p>
<p>The second line of figures gives the
length of hip or valley rafters for one
foot run.</p>
<p>The third line of figures gives the
length of first jack rafter and the difference
in the length of the others
spaced 16 inches on centers.</p>
<p>The fourth line of figures gives the
length of first jack rafters and the difference
in the length of the others
spaced 2 feet on centers.</p>
<p>The fifth line of figures gives the
side cut of jack rafters against hip or
valley rafters.</p>
<p>The sixth line of figures gives the
side cut of hip or valley rafter against ridge
board or deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The seventh line of figures gives the cuts of
sheathing and shingles in valley or hip, for
example:</p>
<p>1. If your roof is raised 8 inches to the foot,
or, as it is called, third pitch, under 8 on the first
line are the figures 14.42. This is the length of
common rafters for one foot run. If the building
is 16 feet wide half the width of building would
be the run of common rafter. In this case it
would be 8; multiply 14.42 by 8, you have
115.36 inches, or 9 feet 7&#8540; inches.</p>
<p>2. To obtain the bottom and top cuts of
common rafter use the figures 12 on body and 8
on tongue; 12 side gives bottom cut, 8 side gives
top cut; the same figures give bottom and top
cuts for jack.</p>
<p>On the second line under 8 are the figures
18.78; multiply these figures by 8, which is the
run of the common rafter. This gives 150.24, or
12 feet 6&frac14; inches. This is the correct length
of hip or valley rafter. To obtain the bottom
and top cuts for hip or valley rafters, use the
figures 17 on body and 8 on tongue; 17 side
gives bottom cut, 8 side gives top cut.</p>
<p>This is all the figuring necessary to be done.
The reason for giving the lengths for one foot
of common and hip or valley rafters is that it
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
will work in all cases regardless of width of
buildings.</p>
<p>3. On the third line under 8 are the figures
19&frac14; inches. This is the length of first jack
rafter, also the difference in the length of the
others spaced 16 inches on centers. For example,
the first jack being 19&frac14; inches, the
second jack would be 3 feet 2&frac12; inches; make
each one 19&frac14; inches longer than the other.</p>
<p>On the fourth line under 8 are the figures 2
feet 4&#8542; inches. This is the length of the first
jack rafter, and the difference in the length of
the others spaced 2 feet centers.</p>
<p>On the fifth line under 8 are the figures 10
and 12. By placing square on stock to be cut
at these figures 10 on body, 12 on tongue, and
marking on 12 side this gives side cut of jacks
against hip or valley rafter.</p>
<p>On the sixth line under 8 are the figures 9 and
10. By placing square on stock to be cut at
these figures, 9 on body and 10 on tongue, and
marking on the 10 side, this gives side cut of
hip or valley rafter against ridge board or deck.</p>
<p>On the seventh line under 8 are figures 12 and
10. By placing square on stock to be cut at
these figures 12 on body, 10 on tongue, and
marking on the 10 side this gives the cut of
sheathing and shingles in valley or hip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;To obtain the lengths and cuts be
careful to use the figures under whatever figure
your roof raises to the foot. If your roof
raises 12 inches to the foot, or half pitch, look
under 12, and so on in all cases. In cutting
jack rafters allow for half the thickness of hip
or valley rafters as lengths given on square
are to center lines.</p>
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The figures on the square, giving side
cuts of jacks, will also give the correct miter
cuts for moulding in the valley at the junction
of two gables, also miter cuts for gable mouldings
where it intersects with level mouldings at
the end of building.</p>
<p>The figures giving cuts of sheathing in valley
or hip also give cuts for mitering level planceer
with gable planceer, also the miter cuts where
two gable planceers intersect, also the cut for
planceer on gable end.</p>
<p>To obtain the bottom and top cuts of hip or
valley rafter use the figure 17 on body, and
whatever figure your roof raises to the foot on
tongue. This will give you the correct cuts in
all cases.</p>
<p>To obtain the bottom and top cuts of common
rafters and jack rafters use the figure 12 on
body, and whatever figure your roof raises to
the foot on tongue. This gives correct cuts in
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
all cases. Always remember that the cut comes
on the tongue, or last named figure. It is so
arranged in all cases.</p>
<p><i>Octagon, &ldquo;Eight-square&rdquo; Scale.</i>&mdash;This scale
is along the middle of the face of the tongue,
and is used for laying off lines to cut an &ldquo;eight
square&rdquo; or octagon stick of timber from a
square.</p>
<p>Suppose the figures A, B, C, D, <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, is the
butt of a square stick of timber 6&times;6 inches.
Through the center draw the lines AB and CD
parallel with the sides and at right angles to
each other.</p>
<p>With the dividers take us many spaces (6)
from the scale as there are inches in the width
of the stick, and lay off this space on either side
of the point A as Aa and Ab; lay off in the same
way the space from the point B as Bd and Be;
also Cf and Cg and Db and De. Then draw the
lines ab, cd, cf and gh. Cut off the solid angle
E, also F, G and H; there is left an octagon, or
&ldquo;eight square&rdquo; stick. This is nearly exact.</p>
<p><i>Brace Measure.</i>&mdash;This is along the center of
the back of the &ldquo;tongue,&rdquo; and gives the length of
the common brace.</p>
<p>18-13 25.45 in the scale means that if the run
is 18 inches on the post and the same on the
beam, then the brace will be 25 45-100 inches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>If the run is 21 inches on both beam and post,
then the brace will be 29 70-100 inches.</p>
<p><i>Care of Square.</i>&mdash;Never use emery or sand
paper on nickel or black finished squares. When
through using put on a few drops of oil. Do
not put your square away with finger marks on
it; nothing rusts it so quickly as perspiration.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_2">
<img src="images/ppg02.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="598" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>
<p>It will be seen that these squares adapt themselves
to other work as well as to framing, a
quality very few of the combination squares possess,
and while combination squares have their
special uses and should be in the tool chest of
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
every expert workman, the
square pure and simple, like
this of Nicholls or similar
ones, should never be absent
from the &ldquo;kit&rdquo; of the ordinary
workman, for with it, if
he thoroughly understands
it, he can accomplish all that
is possible even with a combination
square. If he is not
&ldquo;posted&rdquo; the workman should
procure some one or more of
the many devices or helps for
getting bevels, angles, lengths
and cuts, for rafters, braces,
hips and jacks as advertised
by Riesmann, Woods, and
others.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_3">
<img src="images/ppg03.jpg" alt="" width="566" height="800" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>
<p>With these aids and a good true and honest
steel square the workman can accomplish almost
all that can be done with this tool, or all
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
that he will be called upon to execute by aid
of the square.</p>
<p>These squares are furnished by the manufacturers
either in polished steel, nickel plate or
oxidized copper. The latter style is quite popular
with some workmen, because of its not getting
so hot when exposed to the rays of the sun.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_4">
<img src="images/ppg04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="609" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>
<p>The two sides of the square, shown at <a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>,
represent the carpenters&rsquo; popular square, No.
100. This square has been a
special favorite with workmen
for nearly thirty years, and is
still looked upon by many as
being the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of steel
squares. I show both sides of the
square in order to enable the
workman to see, before he buys,
the kind of tool he will get.
Like the Nicholls square, this
may be obtained in polished
steel, nickel plated, or oxidized copper as the
purchaser may desire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_5">

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>
<p>I show the complete square, reduced to page
size. Sometimes this square is catalogued by
dealers as No. 1000, practically, however, it is
the same square as the No. 100. If we examine
this square we will find on the tongue near its
junction with the blade a series of lines and
cross lines (see <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>), making a figure known
as the &ldquo;diagonal scale.&rdquo; This scale is drawn to
a larger size at <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a> and is shown alone and
is used for taking off the hundredths of an inch.
The line <i>ab</i> is here an inch long, and is divided
into ten equal parts; the line <i>cd</i> being also divided
into ten equal parts, and diagonal lines are
then drawn connecting the points as shown in
the diagram. Suppose we wish to take off
76-100 of an inch, we proceed as follows: Count
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
off seven spaces from <i>c</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, which equals 70-100
of an inch; then count up the diagonal line
until the sixth horizontal line, <i>e</i>, is reached,
when <i>e f</i> will equal the required distance of
76-100 of an inch, which is a trifle over &frac34; of an
inch.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_6">
<img src="images/ppg06.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="194" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>
<p>Quoting from the table of directions given in
Sargent&rsquo;s circular describing this square, we
have, for rafter cuts, the following explanation:
&ldquo;This run of a rafter set up in place is the
horizontal measure from the extreme end of the
foot to a plumb-line from the ridge end&mdash;from A
to B, <a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_7">
<img src="images/ppg07.jpg" alt="" width="473" height="228" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The rise is the distance from the top of the
ridge end of the rafter to the level of the foot.
From C to D, <a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;The pitch is the proportion that the rise
bears to the whole width of the building. The
illustration, <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>, shows one-third pitch; the
rise of 8 foot being one-third of the width of
the building.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_8">
<img src="images/ppg08.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="193" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The cuts or angles of a rafter are obtained
by applying the square so that the 12-inch
mark on the body and the mark on the tongue
that represent the rise shall both be at the edge
of the rafter. The illustration, <a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>, shows 8
foot rise, the line A the cut for the ridge end
of the rafter and B the cut for foot end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_9">
<img src="images/ppg09.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="317" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.</p>
</div>
<p>The portion of square shown at <a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10</a>
exhibits the tool having on its face a table of
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
the run, rise and pitch of rafters, being specially
figured for this purpose, and shows the
measure of the rafter for any one of seven
pitches of roof based upon the length of the
horizontal measurement of the building from
the center to the outside.</p>
<p>The following table, which was prepared especially
for this square, shows the manner of
working the square:</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_10">

<p class="caption">Fig. 10.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c3">RAFTER TABLE DIRECTIONS.</h3>
<p>The rafter table and the outside edge of the
back of the square, both on body and tongue,
are in twelfths. The inch marks may represent
inches or feet, and the twelfth marks may represent
twelfths of an inch or twelfths of a foot
(that is, inches) as a scale. The rafter table is
used in connection with the marks and figures
on the outside edge of the square.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>At the left end of the table are figures representing
the <i>run</i>, the <i>rise</i> and the <i>pitch</i>.</p>
<p>In the first column the figures are all 12, which
may be used as 12 inches or 12 feet, and they
represent a <i>run</i> of 12.</p>
<p>The second column of figures is to represent
various <i>rises</i>.</p>
<p>The third column of figures in fractions represents
the various <i>pitches</i>.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>These three columns of figures show that a rafter</dt>
<dd>with a run of 12 and a rise of 4 has 1-6 pitch,</dd>
<dd>with a run of 12 and a rise of 6 has 1-4 pitch,</dd>
<dd>with a run of 12 and a rise of 8 has 1-3 pitch,</dd></dl>
<p>and so on to the bottom of the figures.</p>
<p><i>To Find the Length of a Rafter.</i>&mdash;For a roof
with 1-6 pitch (or the rise 1-6 the width of the
building) and having a run of 12 feet, follow
in the rafter table the upper 1-6 pitch ruling,
find under the graduation figure 12 the rafter
length required, which is 12 7 10, or 12 feet
and 7 10-12 inches.</p>
<p>For &frac12; pitch (or the rise &frac12; the width of the
building) and run 12 feet, the rafter length is
16 11 8, or 16 feet 11 8-12 inches.</p>
<p>If the run is 25 feet, add the rafter length
for run of 23 feet to the rafter length for run of
2 feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>When the run is in inches, then in the rafter
table read inches and twelfths instead of feet
and inches. For instance:</p>
<p>If with &frac12; pitch the run is 12 feet 4 inches,
add the rafter length of 12 feet to that of 4
inches, as follows:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">For run of 12 feet the rafter length is </td><td class="r">16 feet 11 8-12 inches.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">For run of 4 inches the rafter length is </td><td class="r">5 8-12 inches.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="hst">Total</span> </td><td class="r top">17 feet 5 4-12 inches.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The brace measure on these squares is along
the center of the back of the tongue, and gives
the length of the common braces as shown in
<a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>. Examples are shown in the blade as
at the point marked 24 30, which means 24
inches on the post and 18 inches on the beam
or girt, which make the brace 30 inches long
from point to point according to the rule given.
An application of this rule is shown at <a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a>,
where 36 inches are laid off on both post and
beam, which gives the length of the brace from
point to point 50.91 inches, or very nearly 4
feet 3 inches. Other dimensions are shown in
the square. There is also a scale of one-hundredths,
or one inch divided into 100 equal parts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The octagon scale on this square runs along
the middle of the face of the tongue, and is used
for laying off lines to cut an &ldquo;eight square&rdquo; or
octagon stick of timber from a square one.</p>

<p>Suppose the figure ABCD (see <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>) is the
butt of a square stick of timber 6x6 inches.
Through the center draw the lines AB and CD
parallel with the sides and at right angles to
each other. With a pair of compasses take as
many spaces (6) from the scale as there are
inches in the width of the stick, and lay off this
space on either side of the point A, as Aa and
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Ab; lay off in the same way the same space from
the point B as Bd, Be; also Cf, Cg and Db, Dc.
Then draw lines ab, cd, ef and gh. Cut off the
solid angle E, also F, G and H. This will leave
an octagon, or eight-sided stick, which will be
found nearly exact on all sides.</p>
<p>The board measure, known as the &ldquo;Essex
Board Measure,&rdquo; <a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13</a>, is made use of in figuring
these squares, and is used as follows: Figures
12 and 17 in the graduation marks on the
outer edge represent a one-inch board 12 inches
wide, which is the starting point for all calculations.
The smaller figures under the 12 represent
the length.</p>
<p>A board 12 inches wide and 8 feet long measures
8 square feet, and so on down the table.
Therefore, to get the square feet of a board 8
feet long and 6 inches wide, find the figure 8 in
the scale under the 12-inch graduation mark and
pass the pencil along to the left on the same line
to a point below the graduation mark 6 (representing
the width of the board), and you stop on
the scale at 4, which is 4 feet, the board measure
required. If the board is the same length
and 10 inches wide, look under the graduation
mark 10 on a line with the figure 8 before
mentioned, and you will find 6 8-12 feet board
measure; if 18 inches wide then to the right under
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the graduation mark 18 and 12 feet is found
to be the board measure. If 13 feet long and 7
inches wide, find 13 in the scale
under the 12-inch graduation and on
the same line under the 7-inch graduation
will be found 7 7-12 feet
board measure. If the board is
half this length, take half of this
result; if double this length, then
double this result. For stuff 2
inches thick double the figure.</p>
<p>In this way the scale covers all
lengths of boards, the most common
from 8 feet to 15 feet being given.</p>
<p>This company also manufactures
a square that is &ldquo;blued,&rdquo; or apparently
oxidized, with all the figures
on it enameled in white. This is
really a handsome tool, and the
white figures on a dark blue ground
enable the operator to see what figures
he is looking for without waste
of time and straining of eyesight.</p>

<p>The bridge builders&rsquo; steel square, which is
illustrated in <a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a>, is also made by this company.
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
This square has a blade three inches
wide, which is made with a slot down the center
one inch wide. The tongue is the same as in the
No. 100 square, but has no figures for brace or
octagon rules. It is not so handy for general
purposes as the regular square, but for special
purposes in bridge building, or for
laying out very heavy timber structures
it has special advantages, as 3-inch
shoulders and 3-inch tenons and
mortises can be readily laid out with
it. Another square, shown in <a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a>,
known as the &ldquo;machinists&rsquo; square,&rdquo;
is made by this company. It has a
blade 6 inches and a tongue 4 inches
long, and is very finely finished. This
square is found very useful for pattern
makers, piano and organ builders,
and where other especially close
work is required. A number of other
squares are made by this firm, but
as they are not intended for woodworkers&rsquo; use,
I will not describe them here.</p>

</div>
<p>I would not complete this description of Sargent&rsquo;s
make of squares if I failed to make mention
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
of their &ldquo;bench square.&rdquo; I give this name
to it because of its fitness for bench purposes.
The square referred to has a blade 12 inches
long and 1&frac12; inches wide, and a tongue 9 inches
long and 1 inch wide. The figuring on it is divided
into inches, half inches, quarter inches,
eighths and sixteenths of an inch. This is a very
handy square for bench and jobbing purposes,
and can be used in many places where the larger
tool is unavailable, and may on emergency be
employed for laying out rafters, braces and
similar work. A square that was quite popular
some sixteen or eighteen years ago known as
&ldquo;The Crenalated Square,&rdquo; an illustration of
which is shown in <a href="#fig_16">Fig. 16</a>, is still preferred by
many workmen. The peculiarity of this square
is that the inner edge of the tongue is notched
or crenalated, as shown in the illustration, the
notches being intended as &ldquo;gauge-points,&rdquo; where
a sharpened pencil may be inserted, then the
square may be drawn along the timber or board,
with the blade held snug against the edge, as
shown, and mortises or tenons can be laid out
at will.</p>
<p>Besides being crenalated, these squares have
all the advantages of other squares, and are well
made and pleasant to handle. They are made
by the manufacturers, The Peck, Stowe &amp; Wilcox
Co., of Southington, Conn., in polished steel,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
copper plated, blued, with enameled white figures,
and in nickel plate.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_16">

</div>
<p>It is the simplest of tools, and may be described
as the mechanical embodiment of a right
angle. It must necessarily have some breadth
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
in order to give the tool necessary stability,
and, therefore, as the embodiment of a right
angle it is of a form to give us both the exterior
and interior shape. The blade of the square is
made a little wider than the tongue, more for
convenience, I think, than for any other reason,
for I have seen squares somewhat old, to be
sure, and made long before the tools which are
now in most common use were sent out from
the factory, of which the blade and tongue were
approximately of the same width.</p>
<p>The blade of the square, as commonly constructed,
is 2 feet, or 24 inches long, and the
tongue somewhat less. I have seen squares of
which the tongue and blade were of equal
lengths, and also those, the blade of which were
considerably longer than those of the square of
present make, and still others of which the
tongues were considerably shorter than is now
the rule. But this is long ago. The most commonly
accepted dimensions for a carpenter&rsquo;s
square at the present time are, blade 24 inches
long, tongue 18 inches long, blade 2 inches wide
and tongue 1&frac12; inches wide. This gives for
inside measurements blade, 22&frac12; inches and
tongue 16 inches.</p>
<p>I have described the square as the embodiment
of a right angle. If the square is not a
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
right angle, or to use common terms, if the tool
is &ldquo;out of square,&rdquo; that is, if it is in the least
inaccurate, its usefulness is destroyed. When
the square is inaccurate instead of solving intricate
geometrical problems correctly it becomes
a snare and a delusion, leading to false results
and misfits in general. It is somewhat remarkable
how few workmen test their squares. I am
disposed to believe from long experience that
comparatively few mechanics who buy steel
squares are cognizant of the possible defects
that the tool may have and of the tests which
may be applied for the purpose of demonstrating
its accuracy. Before proceeding further,
therefore, in the discussion of the use of this
instrument let us give brief attention to some
of the simple methods that may be employed
for determining the accuracy of the tool. By
way of making practical application of these
tests I suggest that at the next dinner hour the
reader borrow from his fellow carpenters as
many squares as may be convenient, and apply
to them more or less of the tests which follow,
merely for the purpose of practice, and at the
same time to show to what extent the squares in
use are correct.</p>
<p><a href="#fig_17">Fig. 17</a> shows a very common method of testing
the exterior angle of a steel square. Two
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
squares are placed against each other and a
straight-edge, or against the blade of a third
square. If the edges of the squares exactly
coincide throughout the squares may be considered
correct.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_17">
<img src="images/ppg17.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="601" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 17.</p>
</div>
<p>Suppose, however, that there is a discrepancy
shown by this test, and that as the two squares
are placed in the general position, shown in the
illustration, they part at the heel, while touching
at the ends of the blades, or touching at the
heel that they part at the ends of the blades.
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
This evidently shows that one of the squares is
inaccurate, or possibly that both are inaccurate.
How is the inaccuracy to be located? The two
squares may be placed face to face, with the
blades upward from an even surface, say the
face of the third square or the jointed edge of
a board, and so
held that their
heels, for example,
shall coincide.
Then glance at the edges of
the blades. If they exactly coincide
it would indicate that the error is
evenly divided between the two
squares, a very improbable occurrence.
Compare the two squares in
the reverse position, that is, with the
tongues extending upward. Then
apply the test shown in <a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>, and
finally that shown in <a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_18">
<img src="images/ppg18.jpg" alt="" width="484" height="701" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 18.</p>
</div>
<p>By trying the squares one inside
of the other, as shown in <a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>,
the exterior angle is compared with
the interior angle. If the edges
throughout fit together tightly, first using one
square inside and then the other, it is almost conclusive
evidence that both the squares are accurate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_19">
<img src="images/ppg19.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="543" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 19.</p>
</div>
<p>By tests of the kinds just described among
several squares, the mechanic will soon perceive
from the several ascertained results that one or
the other of the several squares that he is handling
is more accurate than all the others, if not
absolutely accurate. There still remains the
need of a test, however, to prove the absolute
accuracy of the particular square which he believes
to be about right. On a drafting table,
or a smooth board, let him next perform the following
experiment, which is one of the several
that might be mentioned in this connection:
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Draw a straight line, AB, say three feet in
length, as shown in <a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a>. This may be done
by a straight-edge. Use a hard pencil sharpened
to a chisel point. With the compasses, using
A and B as centers, and with a radius longer
than one-half of AB strike the arcs CD and
EF. Then with the straight-edge draw a
straight line, GH, through the intersection of
the arcs. If the work is accurately done the resulting
angles AOH, HOB, BOG, and GOA will
be right angles. Lay the square to be tested
onto one of these angles, as shown in the illustration,
and with a chisel-pointed pencil scribe
along the blade and along the tongue. If the
lines thus drawn exactly coincide with those first
drawn it is satisfactory proof that the square
is accurate, and in the same way the square
may be placed against one or the other of these
right angles in a way to test its interior angle.</p>
<p>The method shown in <a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a> anticipates the
use of another tool besides the square in making
the test. A right angle, however, may be drawn
for the purpose described by a method which
uses only the square, and which does not require
the services of any other tool, or what is
the same thing, consider the tool itself to be the
figure drawn, and then measure for the purpose
of determining the accuracy of the figure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Various writers have discussed the properties
of the right-angled triangle, but we all
know that a square erected on a hypothenuse
of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum
of the squares erected on the base and perpendicular.
This is a well-known mathematical
truth, and it may be applied in the tests we
are making. Those carpenters who have had
occasion to lay out the foundations of houses
are well acquainted with the old rule frequently
known as &ldquo;the 6, 8 and 10,&rdquo; which depends upon
the relationship of the squares of the perpendicular
and the base to the square of the hypothenuse.
Thus the square of 6 is 36, the square of
8 is 64. The sum of 36 and 64 is 100. And the
square of 10 is 100. Now let us make application
of this rule to test the steel square.</p>
<p>For the sake of accuracy we want to take
figures which are as large as possible, so as to
reduce the possible error in measurement to the
smallest possible dimensions. Let us take for
dimensions, 9, 12 and 15 inches. That these
will serve is easily demonstrated. The square
of 9 is 81. The square of 12 is 144. The sum
of these squares is 225, and the square of 15
is 225. Therefore, if the tool that we are testing
shows a dimension of exactly 15 inches measured
from 9 on the outside of the tongue to 12
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
on the outside of the blade, as shown in
<a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a>, it will be proof that the square is correct.</p>
<p>It may be somewhat difficult to make a measurement
of this kind on the instrument itself,
with sufficient accuracy to be beyond dispute.
I suggest, therefore, that the square be laid flat
upon an even surface, like a drawing table, and
that with a chisel-pointed pencil lines be scribed
along the tongue and along the blade. Mark
accurately the distance of 9 inches from the
heel up the tongue, and 12 inches from the heel
along the blade. Then measure diagonally and
see if the distance is exactly 15 inches.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_20">
<img src="images/ppg20.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="460" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 20.</p>
</div>
<p>In what has preceded there has been a suggestion
that the error due to lack of precision in
measurement is diminished if the figures are increased
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
in size. If the size of the drafting table
permits, therefore, extend the line drawn along
the tongue of the square to 3 feet. Extend that
drawn along the blade to 4 feet. In doing this
care must be taken that the lines thus extended
are fair to the tool under examination, for if
they are not drawn in a way to strictly coincide
with the edges of the square then the test is of no
avail. Then measure from the ends of these
lines, that is, from a point 3 feet from the heel
up the tongue to a point 4 feet from the heel
along the blade. If this diagonal distance is
exactly 5 feet it will show that the angle represented
by the heel of the square, as I have described
it, is a right angle, and that, therefore,
the test is accurate.</p>
<p>Now let us next examine a little more carefully
the relationship of the square to frequently
required lines. It is a common thing
among carpenters to use 12 of the blade and
12 of the tongue for a right angle or square
miter. Why are these figures employed, or to
put the question otherwise, how is it determined
that 12 and 12 are the proper figures? Perhaps
the question can be made still clearer by
another illustration. It is common to say that
12 of the blade and 5 of the tongue is correct
for the octagon miter. How is this determined?
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
In <a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a> there is shown a quarter circle, XG,
described from the center C. Along the horizontal
line, AB, the blade of the square is laid with
12 of the blade against the center C, from
which the quadrant was struck. Now if we divide
this quadrant into halves, thus establishing
the point E, and if from E we draw a line to
the center C, which is 12 of the blade, it will be
found that it cuts also 12 of the tongue. If we
complete the figure by erecting a perpendicular
line from the point X, and intersecting it with
a horizontal line from G, thus establishing the
point O, it becomes very evident that CE is the
miter line of a square.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_21">
<img src="images/ppg21.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="356" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 21.</p>
</div>
<p>If we bisect XE, thus establishing the point
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
D, and by the conditions existing setting off in
the quadrant a space equal to one-quarter of
its extent, and if from D we draw a line to the
center, C, corresponding, as already mentioned,
with 12 on the blade, we shall find that this line
(DC) cuts the tongue on the point 5 (very
nearly, the exact figures being 4 31-32 inches).
The line DC, as above explained, bisects the
eighth of a circle. In other words, it is the line
of an octagon miter, and therefore, we say that
for an octagon miter we take 12 on the blade
and 5 on the tongue.</p>
<p>By dividing the quadrant into three equal
parts, as shown by XG, GH and HG, we obtain
by drawing GC the line corresponding to
the hexagon miter. This, it will be observed,
cuts the tongue of the square at 7 (very nearly,
the exact figures being 6 15-16 inches), and,
therefore, we say for hexagon miters we take
12 of the blade and 7 of the tongue.</p>
<p>The question sometimes arises, can the square
be employed to describe a circle? While the
square may be used for describing a circle of any
diameter, providing the capacity of the square is
not exceeded, still those who attempt to perform
the work will very likely conclude before they
are through that other means are more satisfactory
for regular use. The way to proceed is indicated
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
in <a href="#fig_22">Fig. 22</a>. Let it be required to describe
a circle, the diameter of which is equal to ED.
Drive pins or nails at these points and place the
square as shown in the sketch. Place a pencil
in the interior angle of the square, as shown at
F. Then gradually shift the square so that the
pencil will move in the direction of D, always
being careful to keep the inside of the blade and
inside of the tongue in contact with the pins or
nails, ED. After having described the arc from
F to D reverse the direction describing the arc
from F to E. Then turn the square over and
by similar means complete the other half of the
circle.</p>

<h2 id="c4">THE STEEL SQUARE AND ITS USES.
<br /><span class="sc">Division B.
<br />Introductory.</span></h2>
<p>Having dealt with the more simple matters
that can be dealt with by aid of the Steel Square,
we now take up some of the more difficult problems
that can be solved by aid of this useful
tool.</p>
<p>Among the problems and solutions offered, are
those of laying out braces, having regular or
irregular runs, rafters, and roofing generally,
ascertaining the length of hips, their bevels, cuts,
pitches and angles, jacks, cripples, ridges, purlins,
collar beams, and much other matter pertaining
to hip or cottage roofs.</p>
<p>Gables, or saddle roofs are dealt with, also
mansard roofs, taper framing, odd bevels, splays
and other similar work.</p>
<p>I introduce in this division a few remarks
regarding the fence made use of when laying out
rafters, stairs or other bevelled work. The department
also shows how to lay-out stair strings
by aid of the square, and many other things that
will be found useful to the general workman.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 24.</p>
</div>
<p>A very good fence for the square may readily
be made from a stick of hardwood (<a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a>)
about two inches wide, one and a half inches
thick and two and a half feet long. A saw kerf,
into which the square will slide, is cut from both
ends leaving about 8 inches of solid wood near
the middle. The tool is clamped to the square
by means of screws at convenient points as
shown. Another style of fence, which is made of
a piece of hardwood, has a single slot only as
shown in <a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a>. The square is slipped in and
fastened in place by screws similar to the first.
An application of the fence and square combined
is shown at <a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a>, where the combination is
used as a pitch-board for laying out stair
strings. In this example the blade is set off at
10 inches, which makes the tread, and the tongue
shows the riser, which is set off at 7 inches. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
dotted line, <i>ce</i>, shows the edge of the plank from
which the string is cut, and <i>h</i> shows the fence,
<i>a</i> shows the bottom tread and riser. In this example
the riser shows the same height as the riser
above it, namely, 7 inches. This is wrong, as the
first riser should always be cut the <i>thickness of
the tread less</i> than those above it, as shown by
the dotted lines on the bottom of the string,
then when the tread is in place it will be the
same height from the top of the floor to the top
of the first tread, that the top of first tread is
to top of second one and so on.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 26.</p>
</div>
<p>Suppose we wish to lay out a rafter having
eight inches rise and twelve inches run. Set the
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
fence at the 8&Prime; mark on the blade, <a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a>, and
at the 12&Prime; mark on the tongue, clamping it to
the square with 1&frac14;&Prime; screws. Applying the
square and fence at the upper end of the rafter
we get the plumb-cut P at once. By applying
the square as shown twelve times successively the
required length of the rafter and foot-cut B is
obtained. In this case the twelve applications of
the square are made between the points P and B.
Run and rise must also be measured between
these points. If run is measured from
the point B, which will be the outer edge of the
wall plate, it will be necessary to run a gauge
line through B parallel to the edge of the rafter,
and subtract a distance from the height of the
ridge to give us the correct rise. The square
must then be applied to the line L. A rafter of
any desired rise and run may be laid off in this
manner by selecting proportional parts of the
rise and run for the blade and tongue of the
square. For a half-pitch roof use 12 in. on both
tongue and blade, for a quarter-pitch use 6 in.
and 12 in., for a third-pitch use 8 in. and 12
in., etc. The terms half-pitch, quarter-pitch,
etc., refer to the height of the ridge expressed
as a fraction of the span.</p>
<p>The line L is supposed to represent the path
of the fence as it is slid along the edge of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
rafter. This will be explained
at greater length in
the following pages.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_27">
<img src="images/ppg27.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="120" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 27.</p>
</div>
<p>At <a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a> I show a
method of laying out a
rafter without making use
of a fence. In this case the
roof is supposed to be half-pitch,
so we take 12 and 12
on the square and apply it
to the rafter as many times
as there are feet in half the
width of the building, which
in this case will be 15
feet, as we suppose the
building to be 30 feet wide.
As the lower end of the
rafter is notched to sit on
the plate we must gauge off
a backing line, as shown, to
run into the angle of the
notch. This line will be the
line on which the gauge
points 12 and 12 on the
square must start from each
time.</p>
<p>Starting from this notch
apply the square, keeping
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
the twelve-inch mark on both sides of the
square carefully on the backing line, and
marking off the rafter on the outside edges of
the square. Repeat this until you have fifteen
spaces marked off, then set back from your last
mark half the thickness of the ridge-board, and
with the square as before mark off the rafter.
This will be the exact length and also the
plumb-cut to fit the ridge-board. Or if we take
the diagonal of 12 by 12, which is 17, and mark
off 15 spaces of 17 in., making the necessary
allowance for the half thickness of the ridge-board,
it will amount to the same thing, every
17 in. on the rafter being nearly equal to one
foot on the level.</p>
<p>Should the building measure 30 ft., 9 in. in
width&mdash;the half of which is 15 ft., 4&frac12; in.&mdash;we
take the fifteen spaces of 12 by 12 and then the
4&frac12; in. on both sides of the square on the backing
line as before. This will give us the extra
length required. The same rule will apply to
any portion of a foot there may be.</p>

<p>A fence, sometimes called a stair gauge, is
manufactured of metal by the Cheney &amp; Tower
Company, Athol, Mass., which I show at
<a href="#fig_28">Fig. 28</a>, and is considered about the best thing of
the kind. It consists of a piece of polished
angle metal, each side being &#8542; inch wide. One
side is slotted to accommodate the heads of the
set-screws and to allow the slides to be fastened
at the desired points. The gauge is fastened to
any square and is useful for laying out stairs,
cutting in rafters, cutting bevels or other angles.
In marking off stairs with an 8-inch rise and an
11&frac34;-inch tread the gauge would be fastened at
8 inches on one end of the square and 11&frac34;
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
at the other end. The square would then be laid
on the plank with the face of the gauge against
its edge and the mark made around the point
of the square. This would be repeated until the
required number of steps were marked. The
gauges are made in two sizes, 18 and 28 inches
long. It is stated that mechanics who have used
it find it one of the handiest tools in their kits.</p>
<p>Another style of fence is shown at <a href="#fig_29">Fig. 29</a> in
conjunction with a slotted square. This, perhaps,
is the handiest of all the devices for a
fence, but it is expensive, and as constructed requires
a square with a slot in each arm, and as
a rule workmen do not take kindly to squares
with slots in them. A shows the square, B the
fence, SS set screws to hold the fence in position,
and <i>ff</i> the points of the square.</p>
<p>The application of the square and fence combined
for laying out a housed string for stairs is
shown at <a href="#fig_30">Fig. 30</a>. In this example the fence is
a single slotted one, and three screws are employed
to hold the square in position. The rise
is seven inches and the tread is laid off nine
inches on the blade. The square at the foot of
the string shows how the latter should be finished
to make the floor and the base-board. In
case no pitch-board is required, as the square
when adjusted with fence, as shown, does the
work of the pitch-board.</p>

<p>There are many other applications of the
fence in connection with the square that I may
have cause to refer to as I proceed, as it is my
desire to present in this work everything I can
collect regarding the square that I think will be
of service to the workman. Doubtless there will
be many descriptions and illustrations some of
my readers will have met with before, or which
they have been acquainted with for a long time.
The great bulk of readers, however, will be new
hands and unacquainted with the use of the
square beyond its simple application as a squaring
tool, and what may appear to be a useless
rule to the expert or old hand will prove a choice
tidbit to the beginner and will whet his appetite
for further knowledge on the subject. Indeed
this book is prepared more particularly for the
younger members of the craft, although a majority
of the older workers will find much in it
that will interest, amuse and instruct.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the fence or guide used in
connection with the square is, after all, a very
simple matter, and would, no doubt, suggest itself
to any clever workman who was laying off
rafters with the square.</p>

<p>It will now be in order to show how the square
can be used for getting the lengths and bevels
for braces of regular and irregular runs. If we
wish to lay out a brace having a three-foot run
on both post and beam, the matter is quite
simple, for we can take 12 inches on the tongue
and 12 inches on the blade and transfer this distance
three times on a straight line and we have
the extreme length of the
brace from point to point,
and by marking along the
blade at one end of this
length and along the tongue
at the other end we also get
the bevels. This is easy and
simple enough, and without
further refinement will give
the lengths and bevels exactly
for a flat-footed brace.
When the run is different
than the rise, as in the example
shown at <a href="#fig_31">Fig. 31</a>, the
square is applied in a somewhat
different manner. Here
we have a run of three feet
and a rise of four feet. To
get the proper length and
bevels for a brace to fit in
this situation we must use
12 inches on the tongue and
16 inches on the blade, then
the bevel of the upper end
of the brace will be found
along the line of the tongue,
and the line of the blade will
give the bevel for the foot of the brace. In this
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
case the square is transferred three times, just
as though the rise and run were both three feet;
the difference being made by dividing the odd
foot into three equal parts of 4 inches each and
adding one part to the blade, thus making the
gauge point on the blade 16 inches instead of
12 inches, which regulates the extra length and
the change in bevels. A little study on the part
of the reader will reveal to him how the square
may be set to gauge points so as to make a brace
suitable for any rise and run of any right-angled
frame work.</p>
<p>A brace intended for equal run and rise of
four feet is shown at <a href="#fig_32">Fig. 32</a>. Here we have
the fence in use, and the square is shown in all
its positions from start to finish in the formation
of the brace. The gauge line marked <i>0000</i> is
the line from which the marks 12 and 12 are
supposed to measure, and this when squared over
as shown leaves a butt, or &ldquo;heel of the brace,&rdquo;
which is to rest on a shoulder &ldquo;boxed&rdquo; in both
beam and post. The dotted lines on the ends of
the brace show the tenons for which mortises
are made in both post and girt or beam. It must
be understood, of course, that this operation is
only performed once for each kind of brace, and
that on a pattern made of some kindly wood,
such as pine, cedar or whitewood. For the pattern,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
dress up a piece of wood to 4 inches wide
if the braces are to be made of 4x4-inch stuff;
if for larger or smaller stuff then make the pattern
the width of brace to suit. Have the pattern
of sufficient length; if for a 4-foot run and
rise it will require to be not less than 6 feet long.
Run a gauge line three-eighths of an inch from
the straight or front edge, as shown at 0000,
and set the two 12-inch marks on this line, then
screw the fence tight on the square with its sliding
edge against the edge of the pattern, and
then slide and mark as shown four times, when
the length and bevels of the brace will be obtained.
Provide for the tenons beyond the lines
shown by the square, or for a &ldquo;flat-foot&rdquo; brace,
saw the timber off on the lines shown on the edge
of the square. After the pattern is made the
fence and square may be laid aside, as the pattern
can be used for any number of braces, and
when finished with on one job, may be safely
placed away to use again for the same &ldquo;run and
rise&rdquo; when occasion arises. The pattern may be
any thickness from half an inch to one inch.
The same rules may be observed in making patterns
for any regular or irregular runs and
rises.</p>
<p>With regard to the <i>brace rule</i> as given on steel
squares, I may say that there is some slight difference
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
in the lengths given by different makers&mdash;though
nearly all modern makes figure up
alike&mdash;but this difference is so small that in soft
wood framing it has no effect. In hardwood
framing the framer never applies these rules,
but gets his lengths with the square and fence.</p>
<p>The length of any brace simply represents the
hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle. To
find the hypothenuse, extract the square root of
the sum of the square of the perpendicular and
horizontal runs. For instance, if 6 feet is the
horizontal run and 8 feet the perpendicular, 6
squared equals 36, 8 squared equals 64, 36 plus
64 equals 100, the square root of which is 10.
These are the figures generally used for squaring
the frame of a building or foundation wall.</p>
<p>If the run is 42 inches, 42 squared is 1764,
double that amount, both sides being equal,
gives 3528, the square root of which is, in feet
and inches, 4 feet, 11.40 inches.</p>
<p>In cutting braces always allow in length from
a sixteenth to an eighth of an inch more than
the exact measurement calls for.</p>
<p>Directly under the half-inch marks on the
outer edge of the back of the tongue will be
noticed two figures, one above the other. These
represent the run of the brace, or the length
of two sides of a right-angled triangle; the
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
figures immediately to the right represent the
length of the brace or the hypothenuse. For
instance, the figures 36-36 59-91 show that the
run on the post and beam is 36 inches, and the
length of the brace is 50.91 inches.</p>
<p>Upon some squares will be found brace measurements
given where the run is not equal, as
18-24 30. It will be noticed that the last set of
figures are each just three times those mentioned
in the set that are usually used in squaring a
building. So if the student or mechanic will fix
in his mind the measurements of a few runs,
with the length of braces, he can readily work
almost any length required.</p>
<p>Take a run, for instance, of 9 inches on the
beam and 12 inches on the post. The length of
brace is 15 inches. A run, therefore, of 2, 3, 20,
or any other number of times the above figures,
the length of the brace will bear the same proportion
to the run as the multiple used. Thus,
if you multiply all the figures by 4 you will have
36 and 48 inches for the run, and 60 inches for
the brace, or to remember still more easily, 3, 4
and 5 feet, or 6, 8 and 10 feet.</p>
<p>There are other runs that are just as easily
fixed in the mind. 51-inch run, brace 6 feet,
12 hundredths of an inch; 8 feet, 3-inch run,
brace 11 feet, 8 inches, etc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The following examples and explanations on
roof framing are simple and easily understood,
and cannot fail of being valuable to the young
mechanic who aspires to become an expert roof
framer. These examples will serve as starters,
and in the following volume, which will be issued
shortly, more advanced examples will be presented.</p>
<h3 id="c6">ROOF FRAMING.</h3>
<p>Roof framing can be done about as many
different ways as there are mechanics. But
undoubtedly the easiest, most rapid and most
practical is framing with the &ldquo;square.&rdquo; The
following cuts will illustrate several applications
of the square as applied to roof framing, and all
who are interested in the subject can, by giving
it a careful study, be able to frame any ordinary
roof the mechanic comes in contact with.</p>
<p><a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33</a> is an illustration that could well be
given much thought and study. It not only
gives the most common pitches, but also gives the
degrees.</p>
<p>Most carpenters know that half-pitch is 45
degrees, yet few know third pitch is nearly 34,
and quarter-pitch about 27 degrees.</p>
<p>A building 24 feet wide (as the rafters come
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
to the center) has a 12-foot run and half-pitch
the rise would also be 12 feet, and the length of
the rafter would be 17 feet (the diagonal of 12).
Length, cuts, etc., could all be figured from the
one illustration.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_33">

<p class="caption">Fig. 34.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34</a> illustrates a way to cut rafters with
the square.</p>
<p>A roof 14 feet wide would have a run of
7 feet, third-pitch would rise 8 inches to every
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
foot run. Therefore, place the square on 8 and
12 seven times, and you have length and cuts.</p>
<p><a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>. For the octagon rafter, proceed
same as common rafter, only use 13 for run (in
place of 12 for common rafter).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_35">
<img src="images/ppg35.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="166" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 35.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a>, hip or valley rafter. As these
rafters run diagonal with the common rafter
and as the diagonal of 1 foot is practically 17
inches, use 17 for run, and proceed same as
common rafter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_36">
<img src="images/ppg36.jpg" alt="" width="536" height="154" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 36.</p>
</div>
<p>Length of jacks. If there are to be five,
divide the common rafter into six equal parts,
use that for a pattern, and it gives the length
very nicely. But that will not always work. To
get all the different lengths might at first look
difficult even to many good mechanics, but it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
very simple as illustrated in <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>. If the first
jack was one foot from corner apply the square
same as for common rafter, and it gives length
and cut (mark the length for starting point on
next), and if it is 17 inches from the other move
the square up to 17, if the next is 15 move up to
15 and so on.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_37">

<p class="caption">Fig. 37.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig_38">Fig. 38</a>. The side cut of jack to fit hip, if
laid down level would, of course, be square miter,
but the more the hip rises the sharper the angle.
Measure across the square from 8 to 12, and it is
nearly 14&frac12;, which is the length of rafter to
one foot of run. Length and run, cut on length,
gives the cut.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a>, octagon jack. As the octagon miter
on level surface is 5 and 12, it must raise same

length, or 14&frac12;, and 5 cut on length.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_42">Fig. 42</a> is another practical way, which is
simply to lay the square on heel or hip. The

<p>Perhaps the most practical way of all to frame
a roof, the simplest to understand, easiest to
remember, and most rapid to apply is simply to
always take the rise and run, measure across the
square which gives length. Rise and run give
cuts, so you have it all.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a> illustrates a roof 25 feet wide and a
rise 10 feet, 9 inches, run 12 feet, 6 inches.
Measuring across the square from 10&frac34; to 12&frac12;
gives 16&frac12;, or 16 feet, 6 inches is the length of
rafter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p><a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44</a>. If the run of common rafter is
12&frac12;, the run of the hip will be diagonal of
12&frac12; which is 17 8-16, as is plainly illustrated.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45</a>. As the rise is 10&frac34; and run 17 8-12,

<p>Anyone that has studied this with determination
will have no trouble in framing any ordinary
roof, as the general principles apply to
all roofs, pitches, etc. So I will not take up any
more space with roof framing at this time, but
remember all sheathing, studding, cornice, etc.,
are made on the same cuts. In fact a hopper
is also exactly on the same principle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h3 id="c7"><span class="sc">Division B.</span>
<br />SOME POINTERS ON ROOF FRAMING.</h3>
<p>No matter what people may say to the contrary,
there is no method or methods that has
ever been devised that is so effective in roof
framing, or results so rapidly achieved, as those
which are obtained by the use of the steel square.
I have shown in some of the earlier pages of this
work how rapidly the length, and bevels of any
common rafter may be obtained by the simple
application of the square, any determined number
of times. Thus for a building of, say, 30
ft. in width, which is to have a roof of any
given pitch, we arrange the pitch as I have
shown, with so many inches on the blade for the
run, and so many on the tongue for the rise.
This settled, we apply the square fifteen times
to the rafter, 15 being half of the width of
the building. This then gives the length of the
rafter, and a line drawn along the edge of the
tongue of the square will give the proper bevel
for the top or plumb cut. If there is to be a
ridge board on the roof, then half the thickness
of such board must be measured back on the
line drawn, and the rafter must be cut at that
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
point, this provides for the ridge board being
nailed on the face of the cut without in the least
changing the pitch.</p>
<p>A line along the edge of the blade, gives the
proper bevel for the level or horizontal cut. If
the bottom end of the rafter is to have a crow-foot
cut on it to fit the plate, the workman will
have no difficulty whatever in cutting the foot of
the rafter to suit, as all the lines will be at right
angles to each other, and a section of the plate
may be made on the line of the bevel and the
&ldquo;cuts&rdquo; laid off to suit the conditions.</p>
<p>In reviewing an article of mine on this method
of laying out a rafter, an English carpenter
took exceptions to it on the grounds that it
would take too much time to lay out the rafters
for a whole building by this &ldquo;tiresome process,&rdquo;
as he called it. Now the Englishman was right
from his point of view, but no American workman
would ever think of laying out the rafters
for a whole building by the process. He would
simply make one rafter as I have shown, for a
pattern, and use this pattern for laying out all
the other rafters for that particular pitch and
rise on the same roof. Most workmen, however,
make a pattern from thin stuff of some sort, as
it is lighter and easier handled. The reviewer
suggested as a better way &ldquo;that the pitch be
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
arranged on the iron square, then measure across
the angle from the points of run and pitch, and
multiply this measurement by half the width of
the roof to be covered.&rdquo; Now this is all right,
but, as a matter of fact, entails more labor of
a &ldquo;tiresome sort&rdquo; and would use much more time
than the method I have taught now for nearly
forty years. The American workman, however,
does not even require a suggestion as to the
quicker method. He will see and adopt it at
once without argument.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_48">
<img src="images/ppg48.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="373" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 48.</p>
</div>
<p>The method the Englishman would adopt is
shown at <a href="#fig_48">Fig. 48</a>, where the points of pitch
and run are shown at 12 and 8, which makes the
diagonal line 14&frac12; inches. To get the length
of the rafter for our supposed building then,
we must multiply this 14&frac12; inches fifteen times,
then we must use the square at the top and bottom
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
of the timber to obtain the necessary bevels
for the cutting lines.</p>
<p>Regarding this question of preparing rafters
for a common roof, an &ldquo;old hand&rdquo; in the use of
the steel square writes to me to say: &ldquo;I do not
think that any simpler method can be given for
finding the bevels at the heel and point of rafters
than that which you have explained in your
books, but I do think that the following method
for obtaining lengths of rafters, is somewhat
better than yours, particularly when employed
for estimating purposes. The most common
width of buildings in my locality is 24 ft., and
with your permission I purpose to take that
width for the practical test of my method. As
you have given several ways by which the same
result can be obtained, I will ask you to compare
them with mine.</p>
<p>Finding the length of the hypothenuse by the
old rule, we obtain for one-quarter-inch pitch
13:4.99, or, as near as it can be used on the
square 13 feet, 5 inches.</p>
<p>Allowing one inch to the foot and trying your
method we find, as a result, 13 inches and 7-16
scant, or 13 feet, 5 inches. This is a very simple
method, and when the rule is kept perfectly
straight, the results are very satisfactory.</p>
<p>By my way I simply multiply the width of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
building by the decimal .56, 24&times;.56=13.44, or
as near as can be worked by the square, 13 feet,
5 inches.</p>
<p>Let us try the same rule for a greater width&mdash;say
60 feet. By finding the hypothenuse we find
as near as can be used by the square, 33 feet,
6&frac12; inches. By my method it would be 60&times;.56,
or 33.60, equal to 33 feet, 7 inches full. By this
method the rafters in wide buildings are a little
long. Thus, if the building is 52 feet wide, by
the hypothenuse it would be 29 feet, 1 inch; my
way it would be 29 feet, 1&frac12; inches. I consider
this an advantage, as it leaves the point of the
rafter very slightly open.</p>
<p>For one-third I follow the same plan, only
using the decimal .6. Unlike the decimal used
for a quarter pitch the lengths are a very small
fraction short; as, for instance, a rafter for a
building 60 feet wide, by finding the hypothenuse,
would be 36 feet, 1-16 of an inch. By my
way, 60&times;.6=36 feet. A slight difference,
truly. If building is 48 feet wide, then by
the first method we find 28 feet, 10 inches full;
by my way, 28 feet, 9&#8540; inches. A little practice
will enable the mechanic to allow just enough
to make up for the slight difference, so that
when rafters are put together the fit will be
perfect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The one-half pitch can be found in the same
manner by using the decimal .71. Taking the
24-foot building, length of rafters by the hypothenuse,
we find 16 feet, 11 2-3 inches; my
way they would be 17 feet full. Again, building
60 feet wide, rafters by the first method
would be 42 feet, 6&#8539; inches; by my way 60&times;.71=42
feet, 6 inches. By using this decimal,
the length is so near practically correct, that
it may be used in all cases.</p>
<p>For a full pitch use the decimal 1.12, and as
in the preceding mentioned pitch, and it will be
found so near correct that it can be practically
used in all cases.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that I have not made any
allowance for projection of rafters over the
plate. In this case gauge from the crowning
side of your rafter the thickness of your projection;
allow enough for the latter, and find the
lower bevel according to the way you described
in your last; measure the length of your rafter
from where this bevel crosses the gauge line.</p>
<p>A little practice will enable the mechanic to lay
off a rafter in a very short time. I have used
the above myself, and have no trouble whatever.
While I have no fault to find in your methods,
as I know them to be correct, yet it is just as
well that workmen should know other methods,
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
as there are many occasions when the &ldquo;only
method&rdquo; he possesses cannot be applied. Hence
I submit the foregoing, at your request.</p>
<p><span class="lr">W. H.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>All this is very true, and right as far as it
goes, but it so happens that many workmen do
not have the necessary learning to work out these
problems in footing on the lines laid down by W.
H., but, in order to meet conditions of this kind
I have prepared a series of tables which is inserted
in the larger volumes, giving the length of
rafters for any building having a width of from
five to sixty feet and a rise of roof of from
one to eighteen feet to ridge. This will cover
the whole ground, and form a ready table for
the estimator to take his quantities from.</p>
<p>I may be pardoned for again showing the
common and simplest method of laying out an
ordinary rafter, for notwithstanding all I have
said and described and explained on this subject,
there will always be some persons who will not
be able to grasp the method, unless it is put to
them in some other light. I am sure of this
from the long experience I have had in the
answering of questions of this kind through the
columns of different building journals. This is
no doubt owing to some constitutional peculiarities
of both the person who makes the inquiry
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
and the person who attempts to answer it. This
is one of the main reasons why I have admitted
into this work various methods and descriptions
of others than myself, so that readers will have
the same methods described and explained to
them in several different ways by several writers.</p>

to O. That will make the distance from A to C
15 feet.</p>

<p>A method of obtaining the bevels for this
rafter is given in <a href="#fig_50">Fig. 50</a> where the steel square
is shown laid on the pattern with the points 16
inches on the blade and 8 inches on the tongue
applied to the edge of the stuff. The line HO
on the blade gives the bevel for the foot of the
rafter AC. The line OP, <a href="#fig_50">Fig. 50</a> gives the
bevel for the top of the rafter or the plumb
cut, as most workmen call it. Now, there is
nothing in this diagram, which is from Bell&rsquo;s
Carpentry, an excellent work&mdash;from which the
workman can get the length of his rafter, without
complicating matters. Had the figures 12
inches and 6 inches on the square been employed
instead of 16 and 8, then the distance across the
diagonal from these two points would have
equalled on the rafter, one foot on the base line
or seat of the rafter, so that 15 times that length
would have been the total length of the rafter.
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
Better still, however, would have been the application
of the square 15 times on the edge of the
rafter pattern with the points 12 and 6 on
gauge points, then both length and bevels would
have been obtained at one operation.</p>
<p>Of course, the expert workman will often invent,
or discover, methods of using the square
in certain phases of roof framing, that can not
be found in books, or that cannot be taught
because of the peculiar circumstances of the particular
case. Having a fair knowledge of the
uses of the steel, the workman will seldom be
overtaken by difficulties he cannot overcome if
he studies the problems before him and then
employs his knowledge of the square to their
solution, as a little application on this line will
remove all possible troubles.</p>
<p>Every carpenter knows, or ought to know,
that the run and rise of the rafter taken on the
square will give the seat and plumb cuts, but
inasmuch as buildings are not all of the same
width, it requires a different set of figures for
each run, and as it requires an extra calculation
to first find the run of the hip or valley, it
is better to use the full scale for a one-foot run
of the common rafter which answers for any run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_51">
<img src="images/ppg51.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="545" />

</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_52">
<img src="images/ppg52.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="741" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 52.</p>
</div>
<p>Referring to <a href="#fig_51">Fig. 51</a>, we show a square
bounded by A, B, C, D, the sides of which are
12 inches. E is at a point 5 inches from B,
and C 12 inches from B. B-A represents the
run of the common rafter. E-A represents the
run of the octagon hip or valley, and C-A the
same for the common hip or valley, their lengths,
being 12, 13, and 17 respectively. Now since
12, 13, and 17 are fixed numbers, we take them
on the tongue of the square, as shown in <a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
Now suppose we want to find the lengths and
cuts of the rafters for the &#8540; pitch. We take
9 on the blade. Why? Because the run being
12 inches, the span must be two times 12, which
equals 24, and since the pitch is reckoned by the
span, we find that &#8540; of 24 is 9, which represents
the rise of the foot run. Then 12 and 9 give
the seat and plumb cuts for the common rafter,
13 and 9 for the octagon hip or valley, and 17
and 9 gives the same for the common hip or
valley. In <a href="#fig_53">Fig. 53</a> I show each separately.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_53">
<img src="images/ppg53.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="508" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 53.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The measurement line of hips and valleys is
at a line along the center of its back, and just
where to place the square on the side of the
rafter so as to make the cuts and length come
right at that point is a question that taxes the
skill of most carpenters, especially so when the
rafters are so backed. In <a href="#fig_54">Fig. 54</a> I have tried
to make the above points clear.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_54">
<img src="images/ppg54.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="481" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 54.</p>
</div>
<p>First, I show the plan of the rafter. The
cross lines on same represent an external corner
for the hip and valley respectively. Above the
plan is shown the elevation. The sections
1-2-3-4 represent the position of the rafters
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
under the following conditions: No. 1 hip when
not backed, No. 2 hip when backed, No. 3 valley
when not backed, No. 4 valley when backed.
No. 1 is outlined by heavy lines, and sets lower
than the others. By tracing the bottom line of
the sections down to the seat of No. 1, thence up
to the second elevation will show just how deep
the notching should be for each rafter. No. 1
cuts into the right hand vertical line from the
plan, which would make it stand at the right
height above the plate, but in order to make the
seat cut clear the corner of plate, it is necessary
to cut into the center line above the plan. No.
2 cuts into the same points as No. 1, but owing
to its being backed, the seat cut drops accordingly.
No. 3 cuts into the center vertical line,
and in order to clear the edges of the plate must
cut out at the sides to the left vertical line. No.
4 cuts in the same as the latter, but as much
lower than No. 3 as No. 2 is below No. 1.</p>
<p>The outer vertical lines from the plan represent
the width of the rafter. Therefore if the
rafter be two inches thick, would be one inch
apart, and this amount set off along the seat line
(or a line parallel with it) will give the gauge
point on the side of the rafter. To make this
clearer refer to <a href="#fig_53">Fig. 53</a>; 17 and 9 gives the cuts.
Now leaving the square rest as it is, measure
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
back from 17 one-half the thickness of the rafter,
and this will be the gauge line point from which
to remove the wood back to the center line of
hip, and the measurement from the edge of the
rafter taken vertically down to the gauge point
set off on the plumb cut regulates how far apart
the parallel lines of the seat cuts will be under
the above conditions. This rule applies to any
roof so long as the pitches are regular.</p>
<p>Proceed in like manner for the octagon hip,
the variation, however, is practically one-half of
the above results for the square cornered
building.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_57">Fig. 57</a> illustrates the side cut of the hip or
valley, 17 on tongue, 19&frac14; (length of the hip)
on the blade giving the cut in each case.</p>
<p>The latter, however, is for the unbacked
rafter. If it has been previously backed, then
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
apply the square with the above figures on the
lower edge at bottom of the plumb cut, or apply
the square as for the jack, <a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56</a>, to the
backing line, which will give the same result as
17 and 19&frac14;.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that when a workman cuts a
common rafter, he is also cutting a timber that
would answer for a hip for a building of less
span having the same rise, only taking some
adjustment of the top bevel to fit against a ridge.
This is quite plain, and if we refer to <a href="#fig_58">Fig. 58</a>,
we find that the common rafter for a 1-foot run
becomes a hip for an 8&frac12;-inch run, and that a
hip for a 1-foot run of the building becomes a
common rafter for a 17-inch run. Therefore,
the rule that applies to the common rafter also
applies to the hip rafter, <i>i. e.</i>, the run and rise
taken on the square will give the seat and plumb
cuts. The run and length of the rafter taken on
the square will give the side cuts, or taking the
scale for a 1-foot run, <a href="#fig_58">Fig. 58</a>, it is 12 on the
tongue and the rise on the blade for the common
rafter, and 17 on the tongue and rise on
the blade for the hip. The tongue giving the
seat cut and the blade the plumb cut. For the
side cuts we take 12 on the tongue and 15&#8541;
inches on the blade, and the blade will give the
side cut of the jack. Take 17 on the tongue
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
and the length of the hip, 19&frac34; inches, on the
blade and the blade will give the side cut of the
hip. It would also be the side cut of the corresponding
jack if it be a common rafter.
Seventeen is used for a foot run of the hip
rafter because the diagonal of a 12-inch square
is practically 17 inches.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_58">
<img src="images/ppg58.jpg" alt="" width="589" height="701" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 58.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>If we were to use 12 on the tongue for a foot
run of the hip the rise to the foot would necessarily
be less than 10 inches. In <a href="#fig_59">Fig. 59</a> I show
what the difference is in rise to the foot.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_59">
<img src="images/ppg59.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="608" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 59.</p>
</div>
<p>From 12 to 12 is the length of the run of the
hip would only have 10-17 of an inch to one
run of the common rafter, and an equal rise of
the common rafter, set off as at A, and a line
from this to 12 on the tongue passes at 7 1-17
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
inches on the blade, because the common rafter
having a rise of 10 inches to one foot, for one
inch it would have 10-12 of an inch, while the
hip would only have 10-17 of an inch to one
inch and for 12 inches it would be 12 times
10-17 equals 120-17, or 7 1-17 inches. Therefore
the figures given in the second illustration
would give the same cuts as those in the first,
but as the latter necessitates a calculation that
ends in fractions&mdash;fractions not given on the
square&mdash;and for that reason 17 is generally used
for a foot run for the hips and valleys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>

<p class="caption">Fig. 60.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c8">AN UNEQUAL PITCH.</h3>
<p>In the matter of roofing over unequal pitches
when there is no ridge and when all hips meet,
the building being longer than it is wide, the
backing of hips and their lengths and bevels
would be a very easy matter if a drawing of the
whole thing was made, but, to obtain these by
the use of the square alone, is somewhat more
difficult. Let us assume the building to be 18
feet wide and 28 feet long, and having a rise of
9 feet, then, by referring to <a href="#fig_60">Fig. 60</a>, we show to
one inch scale the length, run, rise, seat, and
plumb cuts for the hip and common rafters as
follows: The run of the long way of the building
is 14, and 9 for the narrow way, which we
take on the blade and tongue respectively, as
shown on square No. 1, and to this apply square
No. 2, as shown. AD equals the run of the hip.
AE equals the rise and ED equals the length of
the hip. The reader will notice that the letters
A, B, C, D form a parallelogram, with side and
ends equal to the runs of the common rafters.
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
Therefore, by taking the runs on the tongue,
as shown by the squares Nos. 3 and 4, will give
their lengths, seat and plumb cuts.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_61">
<img src="images/ppg61.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="405" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 61.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_62">
<img src="images/ppg62.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="701" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 62.</p>
</div>
<p>In <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a> is shown the intersection of the
rafters at the peak and as the lengths of all
rafters are scaled to run to a common center it
is necessary that the common rafters must cut
back so as to fit in the angle formed by the hips.
The proper deduction for this is shown in
<a href="#fig_62">Fig. 62</a> by placing two squares on the back of the
rafter, with the heel or corner of the squares
resting on the center line. The distance from
the corner of the square to B measured square
back (at right angles) from the plumb bevel, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
shown in <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>, will locate the point of the
long common rafter at B in <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>. Proceed
in like manner for the short common rafter,
taking the distance from the corner at C, and
for the side cuts, take 14 on the tongue and the
length of the short common rafter CE on the
blade&mdash;the blade will give the cut at AC in
<a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>. The reader will observe that this angle
is the same as that for the side cut of the jack.
Proceed in like manner for the long common
rafter side, using 9 on the tongue and BE on
the blade. These same figures will give the side
cuts of the hip, provided hip has been previously
backed. Taking the last for example the reader
will observe that 9 on the tongue and BE on
the blade the square would lay on the plane of
the backing and the blade giving the cut along
the line BB in <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>, or these cuts may be
found by measuring square back from a plumb
bevel at points A and A, <a href="#fig_62">Fig. 62</a>, the distance
AC and AB, which will give the proper plumb
cut at the sides and intersecting the line AA at
the center. These same distances, AC and AB,
but transferred to opposite sides, set off on the
seat cut or a line parallel with it, will give the
gauge points on the side of the hip for the
backing.</p>
<p>The lengths of the jacks may be found by
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
dividing the length of the common rafter by
the number of the spacings for the jacks; the
quotient will be the common difference.</p>

<br /><span class="smaller">DIVISION C.</span>
<br /><i>Introductory.</i></h2>
<p>During my long experience as Editor of
several of the leading building journals in the
United States and Canada, I have been asked
and have answered thousands of questions regarding
matters concerning building construction,
builders&rsquo; materials, tools and processes, and
particularly regarding the &ldquo;Steel Square and
its Uses,&rdquo; and I have concluded that the publication
of a few of these questions and answers,
along with other matter, in this division will be
appreciated by my readers, and to this end I
insert a number of the most useful items in this
manual.</p>
<p>Besides these questions and answers, I also
publish other up to date matter, all of which
will make this volume one of the most useful
little works to the American carpenter and wood-worker
ever published.</p>

</div>
<p>I open this division with a few hints regarding
the construction, or rather the laying out of
a Hip-Roof where the design has been furnished
by an architect, and which, of course, shows
the pitch and the lay of the timbers. We suppose
the roof to have a span of 18 feet and a
rise of 6 feet, thus giving the roof a one-third
pitch. The fence is used in this example to its
full extent, and when placed on the square and
fastened, the line of fence shows the slope or
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
pitch of roof. <a href="#fig_64">Fig. 64</a> shows the square set to
the pitch of the hip rafter. The squares as set
give the plumb and level cuts. <a href="#fig_65">Fig. 65</a> is the
rafter plan of a house 18 by 24 feet; the rafters
are laid off on the level, and measure nine feet
from center of ridge to outside of wall; there
should be a rafter pattern with a plumb cut at
one end, and the foot cut at the other, got out as
previously shown. When the rafter foot is
marked, place the end of the long blade of the
square to the wall line, as in drawing, and mark
across the rafter at the outside of the short
blade, and these marks on the rafter pitch will
correspond with two feet on the level plan;
slide the square up the rafter and place the end
of the long blade to the mark last made, and
mark outside the short blade as before, repeat
the application until nine feet are measured off,
and then the length of the rafter is correct;
remember to mark off one-half the thickness of
ridge-piece. The rafters are laid off on part of
plan to show the appearance of the rafters in a
roof of this kind, but for working purposes the
rafters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, with one hip rafter,
is all that is required.</p>
<p>To proceed, we first lay off common rafter,
which has been previously explained; but deeming
it necessary to give a formula in figures to
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
avoid making a plan, we take 1-3 pitch. This
pitch is 1-3 the width of the building, to point
of rafter from wall plate or base. For an
example, always use 8, which is 1-3 of 24, on
tongues for altitude; 12, &frac12; the width of 24,
on blade for base. This cuts common rafter.
Next is the hip-rafter. It must be understood
that the diagonal of 12 and 12 is approximately
17 in framing work, and the hip is the diagonal
of a square added to the rise of roof;
therefore we take 8 on the tongue and 17 on
the blade; run the same number of times as
common rafter which gives the length of hip
and plumb and level bevels.</p>
<p>To cut jack rafters, divide the number of
openings for common rafters. Suppose we have
five jacks, with six openings, our common rafter
12 feet long, each jack would be 2 feet shorter.
The first, next the hip, 10 feet, the second 8
feet, third 6 feet, and so on. The top down
cut same as down cut for common rafter. For
the bevel, cut against hip. Take half the width
of building on tongue and length of common
rafter on blade, and blade gives the bevel. Now
find diagonal of 8 and 12, which is 14 7-16 in.
Take this length on blade and 12 on tongue,
blade gives bevels. If the hip-rafter is beveled
or &ldquo;backed&rdquo; to suit jacks, then take height of
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
hip on tongue, length of hip on blade, and
tongue gives bevel. These figures will cover all
bevels for cutting, cornice and sheathing. For
bed moulds for gable to fit under cornice, take
half width of building on tongue, length of
common rafter on blade; blade gives cut. To
cut planceer to run up valley, take height of
rafter on tongue, length of rafter on blade;
tongue gives bevel. For plumb cut, take height
of hip on tongue, length of hip on blade;
tongue gives bevel.</p>
<p>These figures were specially prepared for a
hip roof having a one-third pitch, but will suit
other pitches equally well if the difference in
height of ridge is considered.</p>
<p>For a hopper the mitre is cut on the same
principle. To make a butt joint, take the width
of side on blade, and half the flare on tongue:
the latter gives the cut. You will observe that
a hip-roof is the same as a hopper inverted. The
cuts for the edges of the pieces of a hexagonal
hopper are found this way. Subtract the width
of one piece at the bottom from the width of
same at top, take remainder on tongue, depth
of side on blade; tongue gives the cut. The cut
on face of sides: Take 7-12 of the rise on
tongue and the depth of side on blade; tongue
gives cut. The bevel of top and bottom: Take
rise on blade, run on tongue; tongue gives cut.</p>

<h3 id="c10">SOME QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
<br />FROM VARIOUS CORRESPONDENTS.</h3>
<p>The following questions and answers from
practical workmen are considered among the
very best things regarding the use of the Steel
Square, as they are from men who knew of what
they were talking about. They are gathered
from many sources, but chiefly from the columns
of Technical Journals with which I have
been connected, either as Editor or contributor.</p>
<p>Jas. Willis, Rochester, N. Y., asks: &ldquo;How can
I get the proper bevel for a butt joint on an
obtuse or acute angle, by the use of the square
only?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_66">
<img src="images/ppg66.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="249" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 66.</p>
</div>
<p>Answer: Suppose <a href="#fig_66">Fig. 66</a> represents an obtuse
angle formed by two parallel boards or
timbers. To obtain the joint, A, space off equal
distances from the point 1 to 3, 3, then square
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
over from the lines, R, R, keeping the heel of
the square at the points 3, 3. At the junction
of the lines formed by the tongue of the square
at 0 will be one point, and 1 will be the other by
which the joint line, A, is defined.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_67">
<img src="images/ppg67.jpg" alt="" width="493" height="408" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 67.</p>
</div>
<p>To find the line of juncture for an acute
angle, proceed as follows: <a href="#fig_67">Fig. 67</a> represents
two parallel boards or timbers; 1 the extreme
angle, 3, 3 equal distances from the angle 1 and
are the points where the heel of the square must
rest to form the lines 0, 3; 0 shows the junction
of the lines formed by the blade of the square.
Draw a line from 0 to 1, and the line, A, formed,
is the bevel required.</p>
<p>It will be seen, by these two examples, that
the bevel of a junction at any angle may be
obtained by this method.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>P. McVity, Milwaukee, asks: &ldquo;How can I
draw a circle with the Steel Square?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Answer: A circle of any required diameter
may be drawn by means of the square by using
it as indicated in the accompanying sketch.
Drive two pins or nails, A and B, <a href="#fig_68">Fig. 68</a>, at
whatever distance apart the circle is to have as
its diameter. Bring the square against them,
as shown, and use a pencil in the angle as indicated
in the drawing. This rule is very convenient
in many instances. Suppose A and B
are two points through which a circle is required
to be drawn. By bringing the square
against pins or nails placed in the points, it
may be described as indicated in the sketch.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;Mechanic,&rdquo; Tampa, Fla., asks: &ldquo;Can the
steel square be used in laying out a wreath for
a handrail, and if so, please describe how?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_69">
<img src="images/ppg69.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 69.</p>
</div>
<p>Answer: Some advance in this direction has
been made, but not much, but the outlook is quite
encouraging as many experts are trying to obtain
all the lines required for forming circular
handrails. It will be accomplished sooner or
later. A few problems and solutions are given
herewith: In getting out face-molds it has generally
been considered necessary first to unfold
the tangents and get the heights, and by construction
get the bevels. The method shown is
somewhat different, though results are the same,
but are produced more rapidly. Take for illustration
a side wreath mitered into a newel cap.
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
This method will apply no matter where the
newel is placed, or whether the easement is less
or more than the one step of the example illustrated.
What is meant by one step is, that the
tangent of the straight rail continues to the
point 2, <a href="#fig_69">Fig. 69</a>. The tangent 2-1 is level.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_70">

<p>To produce the face mould, lay the steel
square in the position, indicated by the lines 1, 2,
3, 4, not the figure on the square at the points
numbered, and transfer them to a piece of thin
stuff, <a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a>. Line 3-4 in <a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a> is indefinite.
Now take the length of the long edge of the
pitch board in the compasses, and with 2,
<a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a>, as a center, cut the line 3-4 in 4 and draw
2-4. Now 1-2 is the level, and 2-4 is the pitch
tangent on the face mold.</p>
<p>To get the bevels and width of the face mold
at both ends, take the distance 3-4 on the blade
of the square, and the height of a riser on the
tongue of the square, apply to the edge of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
board and mark by the tongue; this gives the
width of the mold at the lower end.</p>
<p>Next take the distance 4-X on the blade of the
square, and the distance shown on the pitch
board by the line squared from its top edge to
the corner, on the tongue of the square; apply
to the edge of a board and mark by the tongue;
this gives the bevels for the top end of the
wreath. Mark the width of the rail on the
bevel, and this gives the width of the mold at
the top end. An allowance of 6 inches is made
at the top end to joint to the straight rail, and
two inches at the bottom end to form the miter
into the newel cap. The springing line is taken
from the pitch board.</p>
<p><a href="#fig_69">Fig. 69</a>, in which are shown the bevels and
the pitch board will help to make clear the
methods used. The bevel at the back of the
pitch board is for the bottom end of the wreath.
The triangle has for its base the line 3-4 and
for its height one riser. The hypothenuse is the
length of 2-4, <a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a>, and <a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a> stands over
<a href="#fig_69">Fig. 69</a>, level on the line 1-2-3, and inclined
from it in this cast at an angle of nearly 45
degrees.</p>
<p>The top end bevel is shown below the pitch
board. The angle has for its base the distance
4-x, and for its height not one rise, but the
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
length of a line, from the corner of the pitch
board squared from its top edge. This bevel
will be understood better by placing the pitch
board on the line 2-4 and applying the small
triangle to it with its base on the line 4-x, and
its point even with the top edge of the pitch
board. It will then be at right angles to the
top edge of the pitch board.</p>
<p>In practice, a parallel mold is generally used,
and the wreath piece is cut out; both thickness
of plank and width of molding being equal to
the diameter of a circle that will contain a section
of finished rail.</p>
<p class="tb">Jacques Demoux, Winnipeg, Man., wants to
know how to lay out braces, regular and irregular
by the use of the Steel Square.</p>
<p>Answer: Braces and trusses are something
like rafters and when the run is known, there
should be no difficulty in getting the lengths and
proper bevels.</p>
<p>In the first place it is always best to make a
pattern and then mark out the timber work
from the pattern. Suppose we want braces having
a &ldquo;four-foot run&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the brace is to
form a diagonal from points four feet from the
post and four feet from the girt. Take a piece
of stuff already prepared, six feet long, four
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
inches wide and half-inch thick, gauge it three-eighths
from jointed edge.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_71">
<img src="images/ppg71.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="227" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 71.</p>
</div>
<p>Take the square as arranged at <a href="#fig_71">Fig. 71</a>, and
place it on the prepared stuff as shown at
<a href="#fig_72">Fig. 72</a>. Adjust the square so that the twelve-inch
line coincide exactly with the gauge line o, o,
o, o. Hold the square firmly in the position
now obtained, and slide the fence up the tongue
and blade until it fits snugly against the jointed
edge of the prepared stuff, screw the fence tight
on the square, and be sure that the 12-inch marks
on both the blade and the tongue are in exact
position over the gauge-line.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_72">
<img src="images/ppg72.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="145" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 72.</p>
</div>
<p>We are now ready to lay out the pattern.
Slide the square to the extreme left, as shown
on the dotted lines at x, mark with a knife on
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
the outside edges of the square, cutting the
gauge line. Repeat this process four times,
marking the ends, and you have the length and
bevels. Square over at each end from the gauge
line and you have the toe of the brace. The
lines ss, <a href="#fig_72">Fig. 72</a>, show the tenons left on the
end of the braces.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_73">
<img src="images/ppg73.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="609" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 73.</p>
</div>
<p>The cut at <a href="#fig_73">Fig. 73</a>, shows the brace in position,
on a reduced scale. The principle on which
the square works in the formation of a brace
can easily be understood from this cut, as the
dotted lines show the position the square was in
when the pattern was laid out.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to state that the &ldquo;square,&rdquo;
as now arranged, will lay out a brace pattern
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
for any length, if the angle is right, and the
run equal. Should the brace be of great length,
however, additional care must be taken in the
adjustment of the square, for should there be
any departure from truth, that departure will
be repeated every time the square is moved, and
where it would not affect a short run, it might
seriously affect a long one.</p>
<p>To lay out a pattern for a brace where the
run on the beam is three feet, and the run down
the post four, proceed as follows:</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_74">
<img src="images/ppg74.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="146" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 74.</p>
</div>
<p>Prepare a piece of stuff, same as the one
operated on for four feet run; joint and gauge
it. Lay the square on the left-hand side, keep
the 12-inch mark on the tongue, over the gauge-line;
place the 9-inch mark on the blade, on the
gauge-line, so that the gauge-line forms the
third side of a right angle triangle, the other
sides of which are nine and twelve inches, respectively.</p>
<p>Now proceed as on the former occasion, and
as shown at <a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74</a>, taking care to mark the
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
bevels at the extreme ends. The dotted lines
show the position of the square, as the pattern
is being laid out.</p>
<p><a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75</a> shows the brace in position, the dotted
lines show where the square was placed on the
pattern. It is well to thoroughly understand
the method of obtaining the lengths and bevels
of irregular braces. A little study will soon
enable any person to make all kinds of braces.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_75">
<img src="images/ppg75.jpg" alt="" width="409" height="547" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 75.</p>
</div>
<p>If we want a brace with a two-foot run, and
a four-foot run it must be evident that, as two
is the half of four, so on the square take 12
inches on the tongue, and 6 inches on the blade,
apply four times, and we have the length, and
the bevels of a brace for this run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>For a three by four foot run, take 12 inches
on the tongue and 9 inches on the blade, and
apply four times, because, as three feet is &frac34; of
four feet, so 9 inches is &frac34; of 12 inches.</p>
<p class="tb">A young carpenter, Toronto, wants to know
how to find the center of a circle by aid of the
Square.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_76">
<img src="images/ppg76.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="507" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 76.</p>
</div>
<p>Answer: In <a href="#fig_76">Fig. 76</a> is shown how the center
of a circle may be determined without the use
of compasses; this is based on the principle that
a circle can be drawn through any three points
that are not actually in a straight line. Suppose
we take A, B, C, D for four given points,
then draw a line from A to D, and from B to C;
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
get the center of these lines, and square from
these centers as shown, and when the square
crosses the line, or where the lines intersect, as at
x, there will be the center of the circle. This
is a very useful rule.</p>
<p class="tb">Ed. McDonald, Cincinnati, Ohio, says: &ldquo;I
want to know how much can be done with the
square towards setting out stair railing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Answer: In a previous page a few remarks
on this subject will be found and the following
is further submitted:</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_77">
<img src="images/ppg77.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="418" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 77.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_78">
<img src="images/ppg78.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="350" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 78.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a> shows a plan of a stair well having
three winders. The rail in this case will have
two different pitches. These rails are a little
more complicated than those having equal
pitches, as in the latter the major axis is parallel
off the diagonal line B D (<a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>). When
the pitches differ the major axis ceases to be
parallel; and the greater the difference in the
pitches, the greater will be the difference in
the axis and diagonal line. This fact can be
easily demonstrated by cutting a model bed block
out of 2-inch by 2-inch stuff to equal pitches.
Procure a board, and draw a parallel line, say
8 inches off the edge. Now square over a line
to cut the first line; set the bed block on, with
the back corner touching the intersection of the
lines. Lay a piece of cardboard on the inclined
face of the bed block, and let it slide down until
it touches the board. Make a mark along this
edge, and it will be seen, on removing the card,
that this line is equidistant from the corner (see
<a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78</a>). In <a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78</a> the cardboard is shown
as though it were transparent. What has just
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
been done is that the plane in which the rail lies
has been projected to intersect the horizontal
plane which contains the plan of the wreath.
The name by which this line is generally known
is the horizontal trace (shown at C,
Figs. <a href="#fig_78">78</a> and <a href="#fig_79">79</a>). The minor axis (Figs. <a href="#fig_78">78</a> and <a href="#fig_79">79</a>) is
always parallel off this, and always touches A
as in <a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>. The major axis
(Figs. <a href="#fig_78">78</a> and <a href="#fig_79">79</a>) also touches this point A, and is always
square off the minor axis and off the horizontal
trace. It will be seen by this that the rail is
pitched equally both ways; therefore the face
mold will be of equal width at the ends.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_79">
<img src="images/ppg79.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="413" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 79.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>When rails are cut by bandsaw on bed blocks,
bevels are not necessary, as they can always be
obtained by applying a bevel as shown at
<a href="#fig_80">Fig. 80</a>. The stock should lie solid on the block and
square off the sides. When the block is thin it
is best to apply the bevel near the corner, when
a greater surface is obtained. These bevels are
applied after the joint is squared off the tangent
lines. To demonstrate a rail with unequal
pitches, cut another piece of stuff 2x2 inches,
as shown in <a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a>, repeat the process with the
cardboard as before. It will be found that the
horizontal trace has departed from the angle of
45 degrees (see <a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a>) and has approached
nearer one corner and gone farther away on the
other. The major axis B will have done likewise,
as it is always square off the horizontal
trace C. The wreath having two pitches, the
face mold will obviously be wider at one end
than at the other; and if bevels are required,
they must be set off on the face of each side of
the block. The width of the face mold is to be
applied on the tangent line; this makes it
slightly in excess on the joint, but it is better
to have a little margin in thickness for working.
Where thickness of stuff is a secondary consideration,
it is preferable to take the rail out of
stuff which is as thick as the diameter of a circle
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
that will enclose the section of rail; the corners
will then be left complete.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_80">

<p class="caption">Fig. 80.</p>

<img src="images/ppg81.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="302" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 81.</p>
</div>
<p>The following method shows the least thickness
the rail can be cut out of, and also gives
width of face molds on the joint. Set the bevel
to the bed block as shown at <a href="#fig_80">Fig. 80</a>, and apply
at the side of the block. Draw a section of rail
level; apply the bevel again, touching the bottom
corner of the section. The distance between
the marks is the thickness, a plumb line marked
on shows the width of the face mold on the bevel
line. Where the pitches are different the foregoing
method has to be applied to each side of
the bed block.</p>
<p>The bevels may be also obtained by the steel
square. Take the width of prism face (shown
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
by dotted lines) by laying the square with blade
on the line C D (<a href="#fig_82">Fig. 82</a>) and tongue, cutting
at the center A. Note the length on the tongue
of the square. Make a mark of this length on
the edge of board. Now take the width of A
to D (<a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>) which is 6 inches off the blade;
keep this 6-inch mark fair at the end of this line
made on the board (<a href="#fig_81">Fig. 81</a>) and push on square
until the tongue touches the end of the line;
mark by the tongue, and this gives the bevel
required.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_82">

<p class="caption">Fig. 83.</p>
</div>
<p>To obtain an example of unequal pitches refer
to <a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>. To set this out, run a line parallel
off the edge of the board, and off this line
square another. With the intersection A as a
center, describe a semi-circle of 6 inches radius.
This indicates the center of the rail. Run lines
radial from A as shown; these are the riser lines.
Draw the lines B C and C D, which are the
tangents. Draw the diagonal B D. To make
the bed blocks, procure a piece of one inch stuff;
take it to the width shown at B C; square on a
mark about 3 inches from the end (this is to
allow for the shank to clear the saw table; the
block is shown at <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83</a> without the 3-inch
allowance). Take on the steel square the rise on
tongue and going on blade of the straight flight
of stairs; mark on the inch board at tongue;
this is pitch of the first tangent. Take the
height at D, which is one and a half risers&mdash;10&frac12;
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
inches; deduct the height of the first tangent
from 10&frac12; inches; take the difference on
the tongue and width from C to D on the blade;
the tongue gives the cut for the second tangent.
Mark the pitch of the first tangent on the edge
of the second and cut to this; the pitch of the
second tangent gives the edge cut of the first.
Cut and fix together with stretcher as previously
described.</p>

<p>To get out the face mold, procure a piece of
thin stuff. Three-ply wood is excellent, as though
it is liable to warp it does not shrink perceptibly.
Shoot on edge and gauge on a center line; take
the distance from B to D (<a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>) (the hypothenuse
of 6 and 6) on the blade and the rise
(10&frac12;) at D on the tongue; lay on the edge
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
of the board to this. Lay off this length on the
three-ply at B D (<a href="#fig_82">Fig. 82</a>); take the width B C
(<a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>) on the blade, rise at C on the tongue;
find the hypothenuse, and apply with a pair of
compasses at <a href="#fig_82">Fig. 82</a> with B as a center cutting
at C. Then apply at D as a center, cutting
at A. Now find the hypothenuse C to D
(<a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>), and apply the compasses as before, with
D and B as centers, cutting at A and C. Connect
up the points where the arcs intersect to
B and D; this is the face of the inclined prism,
and contains the true shape of rail. Continue
the tangent line C B, 3 inches or whatever is
required for the shank, and square the joints of
the lines B and D. In order to locate the major
axis the horizontal trace is now required. Stand
the bed block on the plan (see <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83</a>). Run
the blade of the square down until it touches the
board; mark this, and remove the block. It will
be seen that the bed block has not got the 3
inches allowed at the bottom, but the horizontal
trace is as easily found with as without the
allowance; all that is required in the former case
being to turn the blade to B (still keeping the
heel at the top of the bed block), make a mark
where the square touches and lay on the square
as shown at <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83</a>. Mark at the blade, and
slide back the square until the tongue touches
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
at B, and also at the center A. This gives the
true horizontal trace and major axis. Note the
size indicated by the arrow lines on the tongue
(from heel to B). Transfer the square to the
three-ply board (<a href="#fig_82">Fig. 82</a>), placing it as shown,
with the blade touching A, and the distance of
the arrow lines at B. Mark along the inside of
the blade of the square and slide the square back
until the tongue cuts at A. This gives the minor
axis. Now continue this line downwards to
guide the position of the square shown at
<a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>. Describe a circle as wide as the rail on the
minor axis (<a href="#fig_82">Fig. 82</a>). The distance from A
(<a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>) to the center of the rail is the distance
to apply at <a href="#fig_82">Fig. 82</a> for the center of the rail, as
this is the point where the center of the rail is
fair with the plank. Obtain the width of the
face molds, and apply at B and D; lay the
square on the major and minor axis as shown
at <a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>. Lay a lath on the square, with the
point touching the outside of the circle at C;
drive in a nail at the heel of the square; shift
the lath until the point lies at B, and drive in
another nail at the side of the square. This
trammel is now ready to sweep the outside of
the mold, which is done by reversing the square,
as shown by dotted lines. Pull out the nails and
repeat the process for the inside of the mold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_85">
<img src="images/ppg85.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="201" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 85.</p>
</div>
<p>Now run parallel lines off the tangent B for
the shank; this completes the face mold, which
is now ready for the face of the plank. Wreaths
for stairs with flights which stand at either
acute or obtuse angles to each other may be set
out by the methods that have been here described.
The only difference, practically, is that
the bed block is made acute or obtuse to suit
plan of tangents. The device shown at <a href="#fig_85">Fig. 85</a>
has been found to answer excellently for striking
out ellipses. To make this, procure two
screws &frac34; inches long, also a piece of brass tube
that will just slip on the plain part of the
screw without shaking. Counter sink out the
ends until the screw heads are flush; cut two
pieces off the tube three-sixteenths and file up
true&mdash;these pieces are best held by sinking
them with a bit in a piece of hardwood. Now
when about to strike an ellipse, drive these
screws in with the collars on to half major and
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
minor, measured from the point of the trammel
to the inside of the collar for the major, and
to the outside of the collar for the minor. It
will be found that if the collar has been made
true, the trammel will slip around the curve
without causing the square to slip about, the
collars acting as rollers.</p>
<p class="tb">W. T. Jones, Boise City, Idaho, would like
to know of a ready way to frame hip roofs and
roofs of irregular or different pitches with the
steel square, including lengths and bevels of
all rafters.</p>
<p>Answer: These problems along with many
others are discussed and explained at length in
my larger works on the Steel Square, but the
following, which is somewhat condensed, does to
some extent cover Mr. Jones&rsquo; inquiries:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_86">
<img src="images/ppg86.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 86.</p>
</div>
<p>Suppose A, B, C, D, <a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>, to represent one
end of a hip roof with a span of 24 feet and a
10-foot rise. The side rafter I D shown in top
sketch will have a run of 12 feet. The common
rafter at the end of building, I L, has a run of
16 feet, with the same rise, so that the ends and
sides of the roofs have different pitches. The
lengths and cuts of the common rafters are obtained
as shown in <a href="#fig_87">Fig. 87</a>, by taking 12 on the
blade and 10 on the tongue of the square and
measuring across, giving the length of the side
rafter, from which one-half the thickness of the
ridge, measured square back from the plumb
cut, must be deducted. The blade gives the foot
cut and the tongue the plumb cut. The length
of the end rafter is obtained by taking 16 on
the blade and 10 on the tongue, which will of
course give the respective cuts also. The same
results may be obtained by applying the square
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
to a straight edge and marking along the blade
and tongue, which will give a gauge line to
which a bevel may be set. By taking 16 on the
blade and 12 on the tongue, as shown in <a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a>,
the run of the hip rafters, 20, is obtained.</p>

<p>Referring to <a href="#fig_88">Fig. 88</a>, it will be seen that
20 on the blade and 10 on the tongue give the
seat and plumb cuts of the hip together with
the length, after one-half the thickness of the
ridge has been deducted from the side cut. The
side cut is found in a slightly different way from
that of a regular hip or valley on an ordinary
roof. The common method is to take the length
of the hip on the blade and run on the tongue,
but this will not work in this case, as the run
of the hip does not be at an angle of 45 degrees
as in ordinary roofs. The line B J in <a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>
must first be obtained, as shown in <a href="#fig_89">Fig. 89</a>.
Joint one edge of a board and square up the
line B L. Measure one-half the width of building&mdash;in
inches&mdash;on this line, 12 in this case, and
with the heel of the square at the point B,
move the square until 20 on the blade touches
the edge of the board at E. The tongue will
then give the point J 15 inches; which is the
length of the line required.</p>

<p>Then take this line
on the tongue and the length of the hip on the
blade, <a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a>, and the blade will give the bevel
of the hip to lie against the ridge. As a general
rule, hip rafters are not backed, but if such is
desired the lines for backing can be found by
setting it to the foot cut of the hip rafter. Make
O R square with S O and gauge back as shown
in the diagram A. Do the same on the other
side, using the distance T R instead of P S.
The point O is of course at the center of the line
T P.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 91.</p>
</div>
<p>For lengths and bevels of jacks, proceed
as follows: For end of roof, and set 2 feet
on centers, take a board and apply the square
to it, as shown in <a href="#fig_91">Fig. 91</a>, with the length of the
end rafter on the blade and the run of the side
rafter on the tongue. Space off 2, 4, 6, 8 and
10 in. on the tongue after marking along both
blade and tongue. The lines, AA, BB, CC,
DD, EE, will give the length of the jacks, as
well as the side cut to fit the side of the hip,
the square being moved down along tongue line,
while the run of the end rafter on blade and
its rise on tongue will give the seat and plumb
cuts. For the side jacks, <a href="#fig_92">Fig. 92</a> gives the
same method, only that the length of the side
rafter is taken on the blade and the run of the
end rafter on the tongue. If it is so desired,
the length of the jack rafter A&sup1; A&sup1; may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
deducted from the length of the common rafter,
which will give the difference in the lengths of
the jacks.</p>

<p class="center">Blade gives Cut of Jacks, also Sheathing.</p>
<p class="tb">These matters have been discussed at length,
in trade journals and also in my larger volumes
on The Practical Uses of the Steel Square,
but the foregoing treatment of the subject is
on somewhat different lines and will prove interesting.</p>
<p class="tb">John Wilberforce, Toronto, Ont., wants to
know if a wreath piece for a single-pitch rail
with level landing can be set out with the Steel
Square.</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the problem can be solved as
follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_94">
<img src="images/ppg94.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 94.</p>
</div>
<p>Set out on a board the plan of the wreath A
(<a href="#fig_94">Fig. 94</a>). Draw the outside circle and the
inside and center line of same, showing also the
joints. Set out the pitch off the shank; square
up the center outside and inside lines from the
plan on to the pitch. The thickness of the
wreath piece is found by drawing a section of
rail under the pitch line B. Set out again the
half-width of the well; square off the pitch lines
to the half width; this gives major and minor
axes of the ellipse, as shown in the development
(<a href="#fig_94">Fig. 94</a>). Lay the square on the axis. Get
a light piece of lath, drive in a nail at the half
major, and one at the half minor; describe the
inner ellipse line on the piece of timber from
which the wreath is to be formed; pull out the
nails, and repeat the process for the center and
outside lines. Draw the shank and also the point
as shown on the board.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<div class="img" id="fig_95">
<img src="images/ppg95.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="200" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 95.</p>
</div>
<p>Now cut at the joints,
allowing an &#8539;-inch for the fitting of the joint
after the wreath is cut and roughed out. Use
another piece of timber about 2 inches thick, to
form the bed block, and cut it to the pitch
accurate and square in thickness. Screw or pin
it to the under side of the wreath piece (see
<a href="#fig_95">Fig. 95</a>), taking care to get it parallel with the
shank, and the nails in clear of the saw. Then
proceed to cut the wreath with the band saw,
beginning at the circular part, and work it to
the shank inside and outside. This operation
should be performed most carefully with a narrow
band saw, having a strong set and strained
tight, feeding very slowly. The wreath should
require hardly any spoke shaving. Knock off
the block and draw a chalk mark across the
table, just in front of the teeth. The use of
this line is to assist the operator to get the outside
of the wreath always touching this spot in
front of the saw. He must carefully lower his
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
hand until it is down level at the shank end.
The top is cut first, and the saw should skim
along the outside top arris, giving a
sweep that cannot be excelled in graduation
of curve. Then set a gauge
to the thickness of the rail, mark a
line on the inside of the wreath, and
cut as before. With a little practice
a wreath can be turned off the band
saw ready for molding. When the
shank is too long, it is always better
to nail the bed block on top of the
wreath, and cut it upside down, thus
getting the curve portion near the
table. Then the shank can be run in
with the band saw when the block is
knocked off. The foregoing is for a
single-pitch wreath as used for
stairs with level landings and narrow wells.
Where the rails are pitched both ways, the bed
block has to be cut at the double inclination.
